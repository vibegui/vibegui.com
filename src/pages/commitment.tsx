          At 25, I was living in Sweden—one of the most organized, stable, and
          predictable countries in the world. I worked at Tictail (later acquired
          by Shopify), a Swedish e-commerce startup, surrounded by cutting-edge
          technology, mature institutions, and an almost absolute sense of
          security.
        </p>

        <p>
          And it was precisely there, in the perfect center of the "first world,"
          that I discovered this wasn't the game I wanted to play.
        </p>

        <p>
          While everything seemed to work perfectly, something in me didn't. I
          realized that, as much as that environment offered comfort and
          predictability, it didn't offer the kind of purpose I was seeking. I
          wanted to be where there was still much to be built. Where talent wasn't
          just another brick in a ready-made structure, but a real force of
          transformation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            I wanted to return to Brazil—not because it was easier, but because it
            was more important.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <h2>From Sweden to Brazil: Building Where It Matters</h2>

        <p>
          When I returned, I rejoined VTEX as a software engineer. There, I
          experienced firsthand what it means to build technology at scale from
          Brazil. We helped create an e-commerce platform that today processes
          billions in transactions and competes globally with the largest players
          in the market. It was a long journey to the IPO on the New York Stock
          Exchange, but it was worth every drop of sweat.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was at VTEX that I understood something fundamental: Brazil doesn't
          just need to consume technology from abroad—we can create technology
          that the whole world uses.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it also became clear that no one changes a country alone. The
          transformation I sought didn't depend only on a successful company, but
          on creating technological capacity at scale—training people, opening
          opportunities, democratizing access to the knowledge that transforms
          careers.
        </p>

        <h2>The Turn: Understanding That Purpose Is Collective</h2>

        <p>
          This realization led us to found{" "}
          <a
            href="https://movimentotech.org.br"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Movimento Tech
          </a>{" "}
          in 2022, alongside leaders and entrepreneurs who shared the same vision:
          making technology a lever for productive inclusion in Brazil.
        </p>

        <p>
          Movimento Tech 2030 was born with a clear mission: to create real
          opportunities for those who never had access to this type of trajectory.
          Today, we are a coalition that has already impacted more than 3 million
          young people, generated more than 7,000 jobs in the tech sector, and
          moves hundreds of millions of reais in salaries and investments.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of our main projects is Maratona Tech—Brazil's largest technology
          olympiad, created to spark students' interest in technology. It's not
          just a competition, it's a gateway to a universe of possibilities that
          previously seemed unattainable for millions of young Brazilians.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Talent is equally distributed; opportunity is not. And technology is
            the most powerful bridge to correct this asymmetry.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Building deco CMS</h2>

        <p>
          Over the past years, building my company, product, and team, I
          understood that my purpose is not just in creating technology—but in
          creating technological capacity in Brazil.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that's the vision behind{" "}
          <a href="https://decocms.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            deco CMS
          </a>
          —a platform that democratizes software creation through artificial
          intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're building the AI application production platform that allows
          anyone—developers, operators, entrepreneurs—to build complete
          applications quickly and professionally. We're not talking about
          prototypes or demos that never go to production. We're talking about
          autonomous companies created with real software, running in production,
          with governance, security, and scalability.
        </p>

        <h3>deco is based on principles I believe are fundamental:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Open standards, not vendor lock-in.</strong> We use MCP (Model
            Context Protocol), React, TypeScript—technologies the whole world
            uses. Our users aren't locked into a proprietary platform. They build
            knowledge and capacity that lasts forever.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deploy anywhere.</strong> Our platform runs on the
            infrastructure you choose—cloud, edge, on-premise. You bring your own
            keys, your own AI models. You own your code and your data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>From prototyping to production.</strong> We didn't create
            another "no-code" tool that hits a ceiling. We created a platform that
            allows going from an idea to a production application in days, not
            months—with the quality and governance that real companies need.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Game Worth Playing</h2>

        <p>
          When I look back—from Tictail in Sweden to VTEX in Brazil, from
          Movimento Tech to deco CMS—I see a common thread:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            I want to be where I can contribute so that Brazil realizes its
            technological potential.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Not because it's easy. Not because it's guaranteed. But because it's
          possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          And this goes far beyond me. It's a movement involving founders,
          engineers, designers, educators, investors, communities, and
          institutions—all seeking to transform Brazil into a global protagonist,
          not a supporting actor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Brazil has everything to be a global technological power—we have talent,
          creativity, scale. What's often missing is opportunity and
          infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's what we're building, together, and I couldn't be in a better
          place to make a difference.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            It's a long-term game. A country game. And it's exactly the kind of
            game worth playing.
          </strong>
