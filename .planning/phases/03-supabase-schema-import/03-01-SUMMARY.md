# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 02-parser-foundation
    provides: Article parser with Zod schema for validation
provides:
  - articles table with slug uniqueness, status enum, search_vector
  - tags table with normalized unique names
  - article_tags junction table with composite PK and cascade deletes
  - Weighted search vector trigger (title A, description B, content C, tags D)
  - Tag change propagation trigger
  - RLS policies (anon reads published, authenticated reads all, service role writes)
  - GIN index on search_vector for full-text search
affects: [03-02-import-script, article-queries, search-api]

# Phase 3 Plan 1: Supabase Schema Summary

**PostgreSQL schema with articles/tags/article_tags tables, weighted tsvector search triggers, GIN index, and RLS policies applied to vibegui Supabase database**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 7 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-16T20:17:13Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-16T20:24:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3 (supabase/config.toml + 2 migration files)

## Accomplishments
- Three tables created (articles, tags, article_tags) with all specified columns, constraints, and 6 indexes
- Three trigger functions active: updated_at auto-set, weighted search_vector builder, tag change propagation
- RLS enabled on all three tables with 6 policies: anon reads published articles only, authenticated reads all, both read tags/article_tags
- Full-text search verified: test article insert produced correctly weighted tsvector with title(A), description(B), content(C), tags(D)
- Tag propagation verified: adding a tag to article_tags updated the article's search_vector automatically
- Security verified: anonymous write attempt correctly blocked by RLS

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create articles, tags, and article_tags tables with indexes** - `dc65359` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create triggers and RLS policies** - `c2d1101` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `supabase/config.toml` - Supabase CLI project configuration (auto-generated by supabase init)
- `supabase/migrations/20260216202024_create_articles_schema.sql` - Tables (articles, tags, article_tags) + 6 indexes (GIN on search_vector, btree on slug/status/date, btree on junction FKs)
- `supabase/migrations/20260216202203_create_triggers_and_rls.sql` - 3 trigger functions, 3 triggers, RLS enable + 6 policies

## Decisions Made
- Used Supabase CLI migrations (`supabase db push`) instead of Supabase MCP tools -- CLI provides local migration file tracking and version control, which is more reliable than MCP for schema management
- Repaired existing remote migration history (20251228002753, 20251228004424 marked as reverted) to align local and remote migration state before pushing new migrations

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Initialized Supabase CLI and repaired migration history**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (table creation)
- **Issue:** Plan specified using Supabase MCP `apply_migration` tool. MCP was unavailable; also no local supabase directory existed, and remote had 2 pre-existing migrations not tracked locally
- **Fix:** Ran `supabase init`, created migration files locally, repaired remote migration history (`supabase migration repair --status reverted`), then pushed via `supabase db push`
- **Files modified:** supabase/config.toml (created)
- **Verification:** `supabase db push` succeeded, REST API confirmed all tables accessible
- **Committed in:** dc65359 (Task 1 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** Necessary adaptation from MCP to CLI tooling. Established a better pattern (version-controlled migration files) than the original MCP approach.

## Issues Encountered
- Supabase MCP tools were not available in the CLI execution context -- resolved by using Supabase CLI instead
- Direct psql connection timed out (likely firewall) -- not needed, CLI handles connection internally
- Two pre-existing remote migrations needed repair before local migrations could be pushed

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required. All migrations applied successfully.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Database schema is fully operational and ready for article import (Plan 03-02)
- All tables, indexes, triggers, and RLS policies verified via REST API
- Service role key confirmed working for writes; anon key confirmed restricted to reads

## Self-Check: PASSED

All files verified present, all commits verified in git log.
