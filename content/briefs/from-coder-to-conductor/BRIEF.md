# Brief: From Coder to Conductor

**Slug**: from-coder-to-conductor

## Topic
A laudation to GSD (Get Shit Done) — the first meta-prompting agent orchestration framework I've seen actually work. Told through the concrete story of today's SQLite-to-Supabase migration on vibegui.com: 5 phases, 8 plans, 49 commits, 33 minutes of agent execution time — completed while I was simultaneously working on 3 other projects. This isn't theory. This happened today.

## Angle
**GSD is the first agent orchestration that actually works — and here's proof.** The article is a love letter to the framework, grounded in a real migration story pulled straight from git history. It shows how GSD's loop (map codebase → interview → research → plan → approve → execute → verify) creates a structured workflow that lets you context-switch between projects while agents do the heavy lifting. Honest about the UX pain (/clear is 50% of the commands). Teases my own fork applying future-based language to this paradigm.

## Target Audience
- Technical founders using AI tools but hitting the ceiling of autocomplete
- Developers who've tried Cursor/Copilot and want the next level
- AI builders thinking about agent orchestration frameworks

## Key Message
GSD is the first framework I've found that turns AI coding from "faster typing" into actual project management. It interviews you, plans, executes in parallel, and verifies. The UX needs work, but the paradigm is right. I'm building my own version now.

## Hook Ideas
Manifesto Declaration (grounded): "The most productive thing I did today was not write code. It was answer questions." — because GSD's interview loop is the key insight.

## Notes
- Link to GSD: https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done
- Tell the story from git history: 49 commits, 5 phases, 8 plans, 33 min execution
- The /clear joke: "About 50% of my GSD commands are /clear. The UX is... aspirational."
- Show the actual GSD loop with examples from the migration
- Honest: GSD's context management is painful, the commands are verbose, you /clear constantly. But the paradigm works.
- Tease the fork: future-based language (Erhard/Zaffron) applied to agent orchestration. Declare the future, let agents figure out the how. More on that later.
- The migration happened while working on 3 other projects — that's the point. GSD lets you context-switch because it maintains its own state.
