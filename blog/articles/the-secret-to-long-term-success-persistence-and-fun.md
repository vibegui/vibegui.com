"If it were easy, any idiot would do it." Rafael Crespo burst out laughing when I said this today, because it's a simple truth. Building a billion-dollar company requires you to "align stars and keep them aligned."

Finding stars to align is already hard. Keeping them continuously aligned, through the ups and downs, is even harder. But this is exactly what separates champion teams (and individuals) from those who fail: champions don't give up in the middle and survive the most diverse tribulations, until eventually finding success (the famous 10-year-long overnight success).

I spent 9 years at VTEX aligned with the vision of Geraldo Thomaz and Mariano Gomide de Faria. Many people were there at the same time as me, but gave up for whatever reasons (no judgment!). Having survived several crises we had, as all startups do, I had the privilege of reaping the rewards: I was a partner in an NYSE IPO, one of only 34 Brazilian companies publicly traded there (a very small number).

"The night is darkest before the dawn."

Human beings never do something with discipline and consistency unless they decide to interpret it as fun and rewarding. Only those who enjoy and find fulfillment surviving short-term setbacks can reap the long-term rewards.

**The important thing is to find the tribe of people you want to survive hardships with for a long period of time!** Once you find them, trust the process. Big things take time.
