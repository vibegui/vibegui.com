Another wonderful week comes to an end, and at deco we always have the Week End meeting from 4:30 to 6:00 PM on Friday. It's, without a doubt, my favorite moment of the week. The structure is:

First, we have **Announcements**.

> 5 minutes — What is relevant for everyone in the company to know?

Then, we go to **Conversation Cleanup**.

> 15 minutes — This week, what did you discover was taking away your power in the company? What realization did you have to regain high performance and be complete with us? What breakthrough would you like to share that can help others in the company?

Then, we talk about **Milestones**, focusing on Results and Learnings.

> 60 minutes — Time to share what went right (our highlights/results), what went wrong (our learnings), and let's showcase our improvements towards our commitments (DEMO TIME!)

Finally, comes the MOST IMPORTANT part! **Recognition and Thanks**.

> 10 minutes — Recognize or thank your peers for something you admired.

This is where you really see how the company is vibrating. This was a week with a holiday in the middle, part of the team OOO, and even so there was a ton of progress and the typical flood of recognition.

**Recognition is not automatic, it's not natural.** There has to be explicit space for people to recognize each other's good work and demonstrate their appreciation. That's why we practice every week. It's simple, but it makes all the difference.

A company's results are important. But for me, **the way you build the company is just as important.** We've distinguished a way of working that I'm very proud of. And that way will deliver extraordinary results. After all, they're extraordinary people committed to an extraordinary future.

deco team, I want to recognize our resilience and our TRANSFORMATION over the last three months. You make me so proud—every week I'm certain I'm in the right room!!!
