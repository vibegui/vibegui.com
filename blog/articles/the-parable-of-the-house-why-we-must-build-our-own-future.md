You were born in a house with many brothers and sisters. It's an enormous house, but poorly maintained, and you and your siblings suffer from various afflictions. All your life you heard that beyond that puddle, far away (the puddle is wide), there exists another house, much better. There are fewer people in that house, and everything is renovated and new. Nobody suffers from basic problems.

And so you grew up and decided that fixing your house is impossible. And that you deserve a better house for yourself. And you navigate across the puddle and arrive at this new house. Indeed, it's all perfect. But the owners of the house don't like to work much. Actually, you're welcome in this house, as long as you don't make too much noise and clean the floors, the bathrooms, and make improvements around the house. But that's not so bad: the house is already well organized, has all the cleaning supplies and resources.

And you spend years improving this house—of a family that isn't yours. The food in the house isn't yours. But it's not so bad... The music isn't yours. But... Time passes. You receive news from the other side of the puddle, and things have gotten worse. Without you there, there are even fewer capable people to take care of and evolve the house. And every day you wake up and work to improve other people's house, in the beyond-puddle. Time passes. Bad news. Your parents die. You weren't there. Time passes. You miss your house. You wonder what could have become of your house, if you had stayed.

One day you realize that every year more brothers and sisters arrive, and that this strange house you've built only works because countless brothers and sisters of yours also believed that the beyond-puddle house was better, and that it wasn't worth fixing their own house.

Then, by accident, you enter the office of the owner of the foreign house. And you discover... that whoever invented all those stories from your childhood, all the songs, all the movies that told you it wasn't worth building your own house... were the owners of the house that enslaved you.

And now everything makes sense. Your house was always deceived. And you gave up building your own house to edify others'.

You die alone, in the cold, without your food, without your music, without your brothers and sisters. But you know you won't be missed. The narrative machine continues, and your brothers and sisters will keep coming to serve the beyond-puddle house, willingly, without knowing that by doing so they condemn the next generations to remain in a house eternally under construction.

**Think carefully before accepting the siren's song of the puddle. Nobody will build our house for us.**
