Today someone sent me this 1958 letter about "How to find your purpose" and I got CHILLS, because I was working on exactly that—a "Zone of Genius" vs "Comfort Zone/Growth Zone" quadrant. And the letter talks about ABILITIES AND DESIRES.

It's interesting how the same distinction happens in 1958 and in 2025 in two different minds. This reinforces something that, at this point, seems obvious to me: human beings are fundamentally different—but equal. They deal with the same experiences, whether in Ancient Greece or on a spaceship to Mars.

Anyway, I agree with the letter. The best model I've found so far is this: find your best expression of yourself, for your abilities, and for that which has meaning—that is, what isn't predictable to happen but you feel compelled to make happen. Inhabiting that space, come rain or shine, you will have a life "worth living."

The key insight is simple: your purpose lives at the intersection of what you're uniquely good at (abilities) and what you genuinely want to do (desires). Not what you should want. Not what others expect. What pulls you forward even when no one is watching.
