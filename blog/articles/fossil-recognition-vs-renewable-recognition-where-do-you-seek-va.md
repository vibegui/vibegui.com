Are you renewable, hybrid, or still 100% dependent on fossil recognition? 🦖 🦴

Fossil recognition is the kind that's finite, has to be mined constantly, and must come from outside. It's not sustainable because you're always needing more and more admiration and external validation. I spent 30 years of my life desperately seeking this recognition from others — from teachers, leaders, women, whoever. It comes from our ego's need to be admired and appear good.

But eventually I stumbled upon the technology of renewable recognition, which comes from intrinsic sources and, every morning, is there again. It's the recognition you offer yourself, and it's also the gratitude you express for everything you've already achieved. This recognition no longer depends on what others think: it starts to depend on your own RESULTS. You learn to recognize yourself through results and guide yourself by the actions that will deliver more results. The rest is history.

Where are you seeking recognition? In others' approval, or in your own results? Results don't need to be explained. Be careful — if you're explaining yourself, you might be seeking approval instead of results. This might be an invitation to revisit your priorities.
