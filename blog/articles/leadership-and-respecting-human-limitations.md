The faster you distinguish that each person has their limitations and it's not up to you to "solve" them, but only to discover how to work effectively with them, the better leader you'll be—including of yourself.

A distinction that worked for me was dealing with these limitations of being and acting as we deal with physical limitations. You don't get *angry* because a person without a leg, on crutches, took 30 extra seconds to exit the plane, do you? Of course not, it would be completely absurd and disrespectful.

We respect these obvious, external limitations. But we don't respect the more subtle limitations that manifest in conversations and language. Learn to detect and respect—instead of resist—the limitations of others and of yourself. Especially of yourself.

**Watch your life take a leap in quality.**
