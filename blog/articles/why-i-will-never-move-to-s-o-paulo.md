Often our future is limited by something from the past. Our natural human tendency is to think that the future is a repetition, or a linear progression, of the past. Therefore, it's predictable what can and cannot happen in X amount of time. I don't need to explain to you that this is far from the truth, and that any future worth building *by definition* is not adjacent to the past, but rather an extraordinary leap.

When you have clarity about the game you're playing (which extraordinary leap you're committed to causing), it becomes much easier to understand "what counts" and "what doesn't count" as success in that game. One of the most important aspects to establish when declaring your future is precisely your "Conditions of Satisfaction."

Unlike the limitations of the past, these are limitations you *chose* for your future, because without them your future wouldn't be complete. If you achieve the results and metrics you declared but have to give up these conditions, you won't be fully satisfied. Thus, this condition of satisfaction transforms into a "Condition of the Game" for you.

I've chosen to play the game "Brazil as a Technology Protagonist," with a minor in "Rio de Janeiro as a Global AI Hub." To play this game, there are concessions that would make the game lose its meaning. Me packing up and moving to São Paulo, for example, is one of them. I'm not committed to my success *at any cost*. If I can't achieve MY success *while* positioning Rio de Janeiro, that success will have been empty.

Could it be that one day I'll have to move *temporarily* abroad (e.g., NY), given the global nature of our company? It's possible and I'm ready for that. But I think that, whenever I'm living in Brazil, it doesn't make sense for me to be "betting" on another ecosystem other than my own—the Carioca one.

So, Paulistas, I love your city for visiting, it has a lot of good things, but... I have an extraordinary commitment to my city, and it desperately needs more people voting for it. I distinguished this text after having lunch with Rafael Duton this week. It's a privilege and a pride to have people like him also betting on our city. It gives me even more strength to continue, despite so many people who don't believe in our future. And everything leads me to believe that we have a golden opportunity to accelerate in this decade.

Rio: The Global AI Hub.
