All violent (or sarcastic) communication hides a person frustrated with something that feels like a great threat to them.

When I get angry about something that happened at the company and react with my team, I'm merely externalizing the frustration of perceiving myself as failing (and forcing others to pay for it).

After all, I only get angry when something is blatantly misaligned with our declared future. But who put our future there, ultimately? I did. Who put the team there, ultimately? I did. Who created the conversations and biases of how the team operates, guess who... I did.

So, if something isn't working... all the PowerPoint arrows point to me. It feels, inside my head, like a threat to my identity as a leader, as an entrepreneur, and as a product developer.

The counterintuitive "solution" to escape this trap, I discovered, is: **ACCEPT THE POSSIBILITY OF FAILING.** In other words, when seeing something broken, instead of finding it inadmissible and forbidden (me failing), find it curious and intriguing: "wow! With this wonderful team and my best efforts, I failed. Let's find out why..."

Done—it already generates immense freedom to deal with what's not working in a pragmatic way without abducting anyone. In the end, it's all ego. Violent reaction is always the ego defending itself. True freedom, which generates serenity and empathy, is accepting with a full heart: I'm an idiot, I fail and will fail. Everyone is giving their best, including me. Now let's get to work.

*PS: despite having clarity on this distinction, this is far from meaning I'm immune to occasionally losing it... as my team well knows 🥲 🙏*
