It's surreal to think it was just this year that we won the Web Summit Pitch! The funniest thing is that we didn't prepare for it 😬 it's almost embarrassing to tell.

The reality is we were in an insane month, with 3 huge events BESIDES the Web Summit. Last year, WS hadn't been very impactful for us (our audience was more enterprise/retail) and we were planning to go to WS only on the day of our stand, the third day of the event.

And then... at the last minute, on Friday, we discovered we'd been called for the Pitch. But we hadn't submitted the deck and it was next week 😂 Result: we spent all of Saturday and Sunday writing a pitch from scratch that reflected our company's current moment. (Weekend warriors Luciano Júnior, Rafael Crespo and Lucas Ribeiro)

But to participate, we had to go on the first day: there were 3 phases, one each day of the event. I went there with no idea what would happen. I gave the pitch. And I made it to the second day! Wow. OK, we went back on the second day, but we probably won't make it here, lots of cool startups. And there we went, approved for the third day. OK, now I wanted to win 😅 so on the third day I went with all my energy.

It worked. And this victory that we didn't plan but, given the chance, executed with great vigor, was one of the best exposures we've ever had. All the time someone sends me this Web Summit ad 🥲

The moral of the story is: **embrace crazy opportunities that appear**. You never know where they might lead. If you use every chance that appears to the maximum of your capacity, one of them will reward you extraordinarily.

(And others will say it was luck 😉)
