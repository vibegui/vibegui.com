It's so sad when someone ahead of their time dies before their time. Today I learned that a friend—someone I hadn't been in touch with for a few years, but with whom I had an intensely and spectacularly productive relationship—is gone.

Remember that nothing is guaranteed. Don't waste time defending yourself in meetings. Listen with commitment. It might be the last time you hear that colleague's or friend's opinion.

Even more importantly... be obstinately pragmatic with your time and focus on results. Nothing is guaranteed. There is no time to lose.
