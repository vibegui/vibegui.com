Sam Altman: "fast fashion era of SaaS very soon."

2.4M views in a few hours. He's not talking about a trend—he's describing what has already started.

Yesterday it took 6 months to launch a SaaS. Today, with AI, it's 6 weeks. Tomorrow it will be 6 days.

The barrier to entry has plummeted. Anyone can create a functional app in hours, but the problem is no longer building.

It's standing out in the noise. Markets will saturate overnight, products will be born and die in cycles of months.

**Iteration speed becomes the only competitive advantage. Those who can't pivot fast, die.**

Brazil has a huge window here. Our devs are cheap compared to Silicon Valley, and with AI leveling the technical playing field, cost becomes a differentiator.

But the window is closing fast. While we discuss whether AI will replace jobs, other countries are building the future.

The question isn't whether you'll participate in this race. It's whether you'll lead or watch from the sidelines while others define the rules of the game.

**What are you building today that could be on the market next week?**
