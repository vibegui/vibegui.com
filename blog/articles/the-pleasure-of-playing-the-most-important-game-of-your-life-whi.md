Call me a masochist, but for me the most delicious thing in life is choosing to play the hardest game you can find—and committing fully to it. This feeling of obsessive searching for which moves are essential RIGHT NOW, simultaneously generates stress, and simultaneously is the greatest possible connection with the sensation of being ALIVE.

What makes a game hard? Any game where extraordinary things must happen for you to win. Brazil as a protagonist in technology—extraordinary things must happen. Building the platform that democratizes AI software creation—extraordinary things must happen. I only want to play games where, to win, a lot of things that aren't predictable need to go right.

Those who play safe games—who have time to stop and do an MBA at a fancy school, who have time to travel 10 times a year, who have time to stress about soccer and entertainment—they may be having a very fun life. But I'm sure they don't know THIS feeling, which, honestly, I wouldn't trade for anything. I want to die as an old man, still playing the hardest game I can find.

The choice isn't about being behind. It's about refusing to play games you already know how to win.

*PS: The quality of life for those who choose hard games is absolutely detestable, make no mistake. You live anxious, sleep poorly, have difficult conversations with your team constantly. It's uncomfortable to commit to a game where extraordinary outcomes are required. The point isn't to maximize your comfort. If you want that, limit yourself to games you know you can win.*
