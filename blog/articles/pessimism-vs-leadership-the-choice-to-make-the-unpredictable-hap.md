The pessimist has the easiest job: they just need to "wait for things to go wrong." In other words, given something that WON'T happen predictably, the pessimist DOES NOTHING and waits for it not to happen. When it doesn't happen, they victoriously proclaim: "See? It failed!" and slowly return to their depressing cave.

The best definition of Leadership I know is: **making something happen that wouldn't have happened predictably.** 

So the opposite of pessimist isn't "optimist," who "hopes things will work out."

The opposite of pessimist is LEADER, because they *BECOME THE CAUSE* of something happening that wouldn't have happened predictably. They DO what is necessary for something UNPREDICTABLE to happen. Note this well: they AGREE with the pessimist. The pessimist is right! Nothing will change if nobody does anything.

But the Leader proposes to take the risk, spend the energy, expose themselves to the possibility of failure (which is highly probable, since it's not predictable).

In the short term, the pessimist wins many more times and looks like a much smarter and savvy person. After all, it really is hard to make the unpredictable happen.

However, in the long term, the compounding effects are overwhelming because, with each small victory, the leader has changed reality while the pessimist has merely submitted to it.

You decide which result you want: you will be responsible for the mental mechanism you employ day to day. Pessimism or Leadership. "It will fail" or "I will make it work." Good luck with your choice!
