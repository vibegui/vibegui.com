Do you believe that 🇧🇷 Brazil is more "efficient" in terms of developers in the economy than the 🇺🇸 United States?

Well, I went to look at data on GitHub accounts by country (a good proxy for active developers in that market) and had a pleasant surprise. Brazil is the second-largest developer market in the Western world. I bet you didn't know that! Larger than Germany, the UK, and France. Only behind the US.

Here's the thing... have you seen the GDP per capita of the US and Brazil? Let me tell you, the US is 7x higher. That's right, seven times more "money per individual" flowing in the economy. Now combine these two things and you get a very interesting conclusion: Brazil has an absurdly high ratio of "developers per GDP per capita." This means we have far more "active devs" in the global economy than we "should" relative to our economic power—more than the Americans, Germans, French...

Happy Sunday, and good luck to those of you raising money and talking to VCs with an inferiority complex who think Brazil can't produce global-market unicorns. Don't sweat them! If you want to chat for help in that process, we're always here to help founders.
