We started the year with over 50 people, a burn rate that only makes sense when everything goes right, and a lot of confidence that we were early enough to figure things out as we went. By March, it was already clear that this wouldn't be that kind of year.

The company came very close to not making it.

What followed wasn't a single dramatic moment, but months of hard decisions, rewrites, tradeoffs, and uncomfortable clarity. We ended the year with 24 people, roughly 3x revenue growth over last year, and operating at break-even. Same company, very different shape.

This year taught me more than I expected — mostly about focus, trust, and what it actually takes to build something meant to last.

## Focus hurts more than it sounds

One of the clearest lessons this year was that focus isn't about knowing what to do. It's about being willing to let go.

AI makes this harder, not easier. Every week there's a new capability, a new angle, a new "also we could…". We felt that pull constantly. At different moments, we were building things that were flexible, impressive, and still not sharp enough.

The turnaround only really started when we reduced surface area:

- fewer bets
- clearer customers
- fewer things that "could" be products
- more things that had to work, reliably, for someone specific

Letting go of ideas you like is harder than coming up with new ones.

A concrete example: we watched Lovable start from basically where we were, but they made more pragmatic choices and focused on the prompt box. Their results speak for themselves. Meanwhile, we fumbled on webdraw and a canvas-first approach that tried to do too much.

The lesson I took from this: emulating other people's success seldom reveals the path to your own. And acting out of envy is a surefire way to get nowhere. The right answer isn't to copy what's working for someone else — it's to understand what you're uniquely positioned to build, and commit to that.

## Leadership closer to reality

Living close to the edge changes how you think about leadership.

There's a version of leadership that's about energy and storytelling. That version doesn't help much when you're staring at cash flow, payroll dates, and the real consequences of past decisions.

This year, leadership meant:

- saying the numbers out loud
- not hiding uncertainty behind optimism
- making decisions that disappointed good people
- staying present through the weight of it

Integrity stopped being an abstract value and became something very concrete: saying what's true, repairing quickly when trust is strained, and not outsourcing reality to the future.

## Growing up technically and operationally

One important shift this year was our decision to move away from a heavily managed, opinionated infrastructure setup and commit to a fully open-source, self-hosted core.

This wasn't about survival. It was about giving ourselves a real chance to become global and to serve enterprise customers — many of whom simply require self-hosting, ownership, and deep control over their systems.

That choice came with more responsibility and more work, but it unlocked important things:

- architectural clarity
- credibility with serious customers
- freedom to reason about cost, performance, and security at a deeper level
- the ability to build primitives meant to last, not short-term integrations

Alongside that, we did an enormous amount of work on optimization — across site serving, performance, caching, delivery, and infrastructure. Much of it was invisible from the outside, but it mattered. And we're far from done: the backlog of optimizations we want to ship is still huge, and genuinely exciting.

## Our third successful Black Friday

One moment that made the year feel concrete was Black Friday.

It was our largest one ever. Preparation was intense: months of stress-testing, tightening infrastructure, planning for failure modes, and making sure we could actually stand behind what we were shipping.

When the week came, things held up. Most customers sold 2–5x more than last year, and the systems behaved the way we expected them to. After everything earlier in the year, that was deeply reassuring. We're very glad for helping our customers serve some of the highest-volume sites in Brazil, and we will only serve more of those in 2026 — globally.

## People, departures, and trust

Several people left Deco this year. Including Lucis, who chose to follow his own path.

I'm genuinely thankful to everyone who did. Every contribution mattered, and clean endings are part of integrity too. Paths diverge. That's normal.

At the same time, I'm even more thankful to the people who stayed. We would not be here without your trust.

The average tenure at Deco is now around 22 months. That's a long time. It says something about long-term thinking, and about choosing to go through difficult periods together.

What we have now is a tighter team with big ambitions — and a much deeper respect for continuity.

I also want to explicitly acknowledge Rafael Crespo (Baby), my co-founder. Through good moments and bad ones, you've been a constant partner — present, honest, and committed when it really counted. That kind of partnership is rare, and I don't take it for granted. It's been great 3 years. Here's to the next 30.

## Carrying this into 2026

I'm entering the next year calmer than before. More respectful of constraints. And, of course... vibecoding every day!

What I'm taking with me:

- a deeper understanding of focus
- more humility around product scope
- stronger conviction around open systems and ownership
- renewed respect for long-term trust
- a team that knows why we're here

By any reasonable measure, 2025 was a great year. It was hard, but the results were real: a healthier company, stronger fundamentals, customers growing significantly, and a team that proved it can navigate pressure together.

The work now is to make those learnings count.

2026 needs to be a year of focused, disciplined execution. Fewer bets. Clear priorities. Total commitment to the things we choose to build. Less exploration for its own sake, more depth and follow-through.

There's a lot ahead of us — especially around AI-native ecommerce and sites built on AI as a foundation. The difference now is that we're approaching it with clarity, restraint, and a much stronger base.

That feels like a good place to start the next year.
