The gravest mistake I'm seeing AI-native product companies make (us included) is to confuse the lack of limits that AI enables for the lack of limits to the product's use case.

Being everything to everyone is the fastest way to ensure your product is both overwhelming and not retaining. Users get too many possibilities, but end up having no specific successful experience which could bring them back. Kudos to Gabriel Vasquez for this distinction back in Brooklyn.

We have now tightened the focus of Webdraw to serve "makers and companies that want to build and deploy production AI applications that MAKE or SAVE them money."

This clarity is immensely rewarding. We are having crystal clear conversations with both huge companies and individual AI creators who are very happy with what we've built and very anxious for what we're shipping next.

There is a golden age of AI Apps coming which will replace Big SaaS, indeed! I'm very happy that Webdraw will play a part in enabling it, and allow a lot of people to make (or save) their first dollar with AI.
