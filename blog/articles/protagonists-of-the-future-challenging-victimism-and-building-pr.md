I have a friend who insists on saying that "the system is wrong," that the world is getting worse, that nothing has a solution... I don't know what world my friend lives in, but here on planet Earth, capitalism, science, technology, and democracy have been generating unprecedented prosperity. Just look at the data on infant mortality, access to education, poverty, and life expectancy.

Do you also have friends who love to complain about everything but don't do anything pragmatic to improve the world? And you, do you also think the system is wrong, that we are oppressed, victims of a conspiratorial capitalist elite? Or have you already figured out that you are responsible for your destiny and the destiny of our country?

Before you confuse me for an anarcho-liberal neo-patriot, let me be clear: I want a strong State that punishes greedy companies and invests in the country. I want assistance for the poor. I want a universal health and education system. But that's where my alliance with the left ends: the rest of the victimism and the paranoid persecution complex that everything is a conspiracy of the rich against the poor, I refuse to entertain.

I wish I had distinguished the following earlier: "money" is not the problem. Who controls the money *currently* is the problem. But that is perfectly solvable. You just have to make more money, faster, than them.

We can change the priorities of our society. We can finance a rebellious and prosperous country. But only if our youth (and especially our educated youth, our *intellectual elite*) believes that they are protagonists of the future, not victims of the past.

**The past doesn't determine the future. The future is made now. Let's be protagonists of the world's prosperity!**
