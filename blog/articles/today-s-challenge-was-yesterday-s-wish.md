Every time I feel overwhelmed by the real-life challenges of serving ~a billion pageviews (hello Black Friday), I remember that, once upon a time, this was my greatest wish, and it took a lot of work to get here.

It's easy to forget how today's challenge was yesterday's wish: once achieved, we're already thinking about the next challenge.

**All your challenges today were once wishes! Be grateful to have them.** And of course, always feel free to declare new wishes.
