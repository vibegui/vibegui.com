The exact measure of your self-esteem is how much you invest in your tools and in yourself. What an interesting distinction.

I always took great pride in being an economical and efficient person. When I built a computer, I did deep research on the cheapest parts with the best cost-benefit ratio. When I bought a car, I got a great used one. Phone? Android, obviously!

I never allowed myself to have the best thing. I associated having the best thing with extravagance—it's a sin. Why have the best thing if I can get 80% of the result for 20% of the price by getting the third-best thing?

At the beginning of this year, at 33, for the first time I bought *the best MacBook Pro available* with an obscene amount of memory that can run 700 Chrome tabs without breaking a sweat. I could have (financially) bought "the best MacBook Pro available" 5, or even 10 years ago. But I couldn't.

Psychology has a term called "self-efficacy" which means the belief that you can depend on yourself and are capable of achieving results and overcoming problems. The more you recognize your own value, the more obvious it becomes to invest in yourself to have the best tools and conditions to overcome problems. This applies to all spheres of life—from computers to giving yourself time for your health and your family.

The best thing you can do for the world, counterintuitively, is to learn to value yourself! After all, this is the only investment over which you have total control: your words, your actions, and your results.
