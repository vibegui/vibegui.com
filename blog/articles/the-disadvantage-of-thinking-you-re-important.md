I feel sorry for people who go through life thinking they're very important. It's a massive disadvantage I carried for a long time. If you take yourself too seriously, you lose the ability to remain open to learning simple things that contradict your sense of importance.

I spent this week in New York talking with (half of) the world's largest funds. The smartest investors listen with total commitment, without needing to be important. Just wanting to discover what there is to discover in the conversation.

And the less importance I give myself in the conversation, the more I can authentically learn from their opinions and questions. I've reinvented myself about three times this week, each time throwing out the window things that, if I were important, I would want to defend with everything I had. Thank God I'm not that important! What's important is building the largest consumer AI network on the planet.

Thinking you're important means being defined by your past—which is poverty, given that it's limited. 

I am defined by my future. And it is infinite in possibilities.
