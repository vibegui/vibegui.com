"Make something people want" is NOT ENOUGH! If I knew how Paul Graham was subtly wrong with that sentence, it would've saved me and my company two years worth of building. Here's why:

People *want* a lot of things, but they will hardly ever CHANGE HABITS over something unless it REALLY moves the needle in a very substantial way. This means you need to build something that people would KILL FOR, not merely want.

The distinction is huge. When you are building something people would KILL FOR, they have a *violent* reaction when you first show it to them. They say things like: "Can I use this right now?" or "How much do I have to pay?". They don't say "yeah that sounds cool". They don't merely sign up for your waitlist. They sign up in droves and they MESSAGE you asking for an early invite.

It's very hard, as a founder, to spend a few months building something and realizing that people want it, you can even sell it to them, but they don't want it ENOUGH to really create a tidal wave of pulling. It's very hard to admit to yourself that this dear thing you've labored over for months is not THAT amazing.

But this is the most effective pill you have to swallow in order to LET GO of this thing you built and start falling in love with a POSSIBILITY for a NEW PROBLEM, a NEW CATEGORY that literally doesn't exist yet, but you are well positioned to articulate — and address. This new category, once existing, creates a MASSIVE demand, instantly! Because the demand was *already there*, but it was poorly or not-at-all articulated.

We spent two years at deco trying to be *better* than other CMS's, *better* than Vercel, *better* than Optimizely — and do it all at once, lol! We ended up even excelling at some of those things, arguably being 2-3x better than some of those in different aspects. But that doesn't matter. It's not enough.

Now, Webdraw is a completely different beast. We are solving *precisely* the same problem: allowing people to express themselves through web software. But before, we were constrained by the current rules of the game: if you want to have custom software, you will need dedicated software developers. And you can make it as easy as you want, they are still 0.001% of the population!

Now, you can just *build custom software yourself*. Really, complex, working online SaaS-like web apps. That talk to actual databases. That can read and write from Google Sheets. That can interact with Airtable or Oracle or SAP.

This literally means that businesses will be able to evolve their software on a DAILY basis, not on sprints or months or years. People will evolve the software they use themselves, all the time.

Now THAT's not 3x better. That is a whole new category. It solves the same problem, but making 1000x more people powerful. So I hope you can let go of your initial idea as quickly as possible!

The REAL idea lies just ahead. As soon as you let go.
