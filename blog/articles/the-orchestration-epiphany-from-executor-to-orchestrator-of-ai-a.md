I had an epiphany today: in a world where I can set an objective, turn on the token faucet, and watch work happen until the objective is achieved, every moment I leave the computer without it thinking is monumental waste.

I realized that what I want most is a UI to orchestrate all my long-running tasks. **I'm no longer the executor — I'm the one who orchestrates work threads and interacts when necessary.**

Instead of a PR tab open on GitHub, I want a live conversation with my agent. It keeps working on the code, testing, iterating, until it finishes or calls me to unblock.

Doing this, I discovered that my true job is "Context Design" for my agents.

My agents are only objective when I design the right context. It's not enough to give access to data. I need to think about which MCPs, tools, permissions, and memory each workflow needs. And when I can trust the result versus when I have to verify and approve.

The financial agent needs ERP + history + policies. The content one needs brand guide + analytics + site. Each one with context designed to be precise in its function, using the minimum tokens possible.

We're rethinking the company from scratch this way. Each process becomes an agent with specific context. Our team is vibecoding agentic workflows every day, and getting increasingly surprised by the results.

**The reasoning faucet has arrived.** Every second your computer isn't working for you is a huge opportunity cost. How many agents are you orchestrating per day?
