You can confuse yourself with as many metrics as you want to invent, but you'll always return to the only two dimensions that REALLY compose success:

**Alignment:** all conversations are informed by an extraordinary future to which everyone nurtures an authentic commitment (generally, the result of having co-created it).

**Integrity:** all conversations are COMPLETE, meaning nothing hidden, nothing missing, nothing left uncommunicated directly.

**Examples of lack of alignment:**

- Team discussing priorities without connection to declared objectives.
- Giving opinions about the future without being committed to making it happen.
- Decisions being made by convenience, not by consistency with what was declared.

**Examples of lack of integrity:**

- Someone doesn't say what they really think for fear of conflict.
- Problems are swept under the rug "so as not to disrupt things now."
- Important conversations are outsourced or postponed indefinitely.

A leader doesn't allow dirty conversations. Every lack of alignment or integrity destroys performance and puts the future at risk, so it must be invited to immediate resolution as soon as discovered.

In a high-performance organization, everyone is a leader and, therefore, everyone shares responsibility for the alignment and integrity of the conversations they participate in daily.

**My invitation for you to increase your performance and that of everyone around you by 500%:**

Be a leader in your network of conversations. Demand that your colleagues call the other person to talk and clarify. Doubt any misinterpretation. Help separate facts from stories. Encourage people to listen with commitment and verify directly before assuming anything.

Do this with consistency and you'll be a recognizably special person within your organization very quickly. For a simple reason: almost nobody is willing to do it. It requires uncomfortable conversations on a common and regular basis. And for that, you need to give up looking good and being right.

High performance isn't complicated—it really comes down to alignment and integrity. As Olga would say: "simple and difficult." If it were easy, everyone would do it.
