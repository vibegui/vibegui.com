Yesterday I had the privilege of interviewing Professor Roberto Mangabeira Unger. Those who know me know that since my VTEX days, I had the dream of bringing him to an event. And it happened—at deco.day?

The professor's ideas are revolutionary. He is a man truly ahead of his time. This means he already inhabits a future that, for most of us, is as powerful as it is improbable.

This causes him to be misunderstood—and even rejected—by both the left and the right. It's obvious: his ideas don't fit this antiquated dichotomy!

We need to listen to the professor to have the AUDACITY to build a country that doesn't ask permission, that doesn't wait for the developmental formula from gringos to copy.

**This is the century of the Global South.** We will invent new productive and economic mechanisms capable of lifting up the Brazilian masses, inviting them to the new productive vanguard of the world: the knowledge economy.

Read this book. Then you'll have another perspective on why we are building a company based on COMMUNITY and ECOSYSTEM.

*A rising tide lifts all boats.*
