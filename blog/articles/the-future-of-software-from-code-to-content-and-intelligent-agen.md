From now on, software is content. It might take another year or two, but I suspect that writing code will really become as desirable as writing assembly.

On the other hand, software no longer needs to be exhaustively explicit in every detail. With intelligence becoming a commodity, anyone can package their knowledge into an AI in natural language terms and scale their own work.

The new software (content) that will be written from now on, I believe, will mostly be a set of instructions, tools, and limits for agents. We will stop *doing digital work* (e.g., going to the platform to configure ads, or going to a site to buy something) and will teach and command agents that do this work for us.

In this new world, the name of the game is: how do I teach my agents, how do I give them context, and mainly, how will they allocate my capital. All sectors and individuals in a company have a certain budget to fulfill their tasks. With agents, it won't be any different.

This is our task: helping to recruit and build the agents that a company needs, centralizing their control and context in a unified workspace with secure access to the data sources they need to do *real work*.
