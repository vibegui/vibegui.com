I HATE it when someone reviews Brazilian software and says, astonished, that it "competes head-to-head" with foreign tools. Really? You expected it to compete... sideways?

Think about what's implied in that phrase. For that to be a "positive surprise," the baseline expectation must be that we're inferior. 

And we're not.

We have the second-largest developer community in the Western world. We've built world-class companies. We've shipped products used by millions globally.

The inferiority complex isn't about our code. It's about our beliefs. 

When we expect to be worse, we celebrate mediocrity as success. When we assume foreign is better, we don't push ourselves to lead.

Stop being surprised when Brazilian software is excellent. Start expecting it.
