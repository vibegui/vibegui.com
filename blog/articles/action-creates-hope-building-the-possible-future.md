It deeply irritates and saddens me that most people live their lives from: "Let me show you what happened in the past, and explain how everything is going to go wrong and stay bad."

It's unbelievable that they don't realize that, by doing so, they create their own prison. Mangabeira already taught us: action is not the consequence of hope—it GENERATES hope. It doesn't matter the motivation for the action—it can be anger, envy, remorse, greed, or altruism. What matters is ACTING.

I prefer to live life from: "Let me show you the future that is possible, and show you why it's worth working to build that future, even given the current conditions of the game."

Singapore was a backwater just yesterday. China had the same GDP as Brazil 80 years ago. But Brazil has no hope?

STOP EXPLAINING WHY BRAZIL IS GOING TO FAIL WHILE PAYING TAXES IN DOLLARS/EUROS/POUNDS. COME BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY AND WORK TO MAKE IT SUCCEED! Damn!

Good morning.
