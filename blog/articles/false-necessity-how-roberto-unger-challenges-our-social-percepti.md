Harvard's most radical professor taught one dangerous idea for 40 years:

Everything you think is "fixed" about society is actually an illusion. Here's why:

Our world isn't governed by natural laws or inevitable processes. Every institution, every rule, every "that's just how things work" was created through human choices and struggle.

Roberto Mangabeira Unger calls this "false necessity" — the widespread belief that things MUST be the way they are.

But here's the revolutionary truth: **If humans made these rules, humans can remake them.**

Your job isn't fixed.
Your social class isn't fixed.
Your country's destiny isn't fixed.

We're not just products of our environment — we're "context-transcending" beings. While bound by social contexts, we possess an infinite capacity to reimagine and rebuild them.

This matters because our current institutions actively resist transformation:

• Education systems cultivate conformity over creativity
• Economic structures protect established powers
• Social systems perpetuate existing hierarchies

But there's hope.

Time is real.
History is singular.
There are no predetermined paths.

This means you're not trapped by circumstances — you're a creator of reality.

The gap between current conditions and potential isn't natural law. It's a space for transformation. It's your opportunity for decisive action.

Society isn't a fixed structure that contains us. It's a canvas waiting for our imagination.

The future isn't determined by deep structural laws. It's written by those who challenge existing arrangements. By those who dare to imagine something better.
