If there's one thing I BITTERLY regret (not) doing at deco.cx, it was not starting open-source from the beginning. I kept deferring the focus on extensibility by the community because "the product wasn't ready" or "we still had to focus on customers and prove value" or... etc.

There was always a reason not to stop and focus on BEING EXTENSIBLE as a priority, as a reason for being. But the truth is that the reason was a hidden profit: "we get to maintain total control." This is an addiction of product makers, from designers to engineers, that has to do with the arrogant distrust that "users can only make our art worse." Predictable result: the product only evolves at the speed of our team. No matter how good the team is, it's an unviable speed to dominate the world.

A platform can only maximize its value from the moment it establishes a positive feedback loop: the more people extending my platform, the better my platform becomes for everyone. It's the famous network effect: the more users participating, the better the network becomes for everyone. That's why when you join LinkedIn it asks for your contacts: to connect you with people you know (retention) and help you invite those who haven't come yet (attraction).

Today, this is the most important conversation at Webdraw. We're evolving by leaps and bounds and having heated discussions and daily breakthroughs. But if there's one thing I won't give up, that it's absolutely unviable for us to get wrong again, it's this: **extensibility and community protagonism is PRIORITY ZERO.** We will be as giant as we can get people to create Webdraw TOGETHER with us. And when that happens, there won't be a GitHub Spark, there won't be an Adobe, there won't be a Figma that can stop us.

You think Draw is just drawing? Draw is also what attracts and leads. "Webdraw" is the new gravitational center of digitalization, pulling everything to the web and helping you extract the maximum from the web. A new paradigm to create and consume the web, at the insane speed of artificial intelligence.

And it was born in Brazil, made by Cariocas, Paraibanos, Paulistas... But never by "stray dogs." No stray dogs on the team, except for Moela, Jose Miguel's actual dog.
