Companies don't end because they run out of money. They end because people stop believing and caring about a powerful future.

If there's one thing that's forbidden in our company, it's "apathy."

You can disagree with any idea, you can get angry, you can spit in my face during a discussion, and none of that will result in you leaving the team.

But the moment a person "unplugs" from week start meetings, week end meetings, and mini demos (our daily half-hour show-and-tell space at the end of the afternoon), it means the person has "given up on being a protagonist" in the company's future.

Our company is remote, everyone stays on Discord and we have precious little moments of sync rituals. Disengaging from these rituals is disengaging from the future.

Understand, I'm not being precious or tyrannical. It's that it's *literally impossible* to build something truly innovative and high quality if the ENTIRE team isn't infinitely excited and super engaged.

**Each person who is disengaged on your team is a silent vector of deceleration and disbelief.** It slows down everyone around them, because they're just doing the minimum.

Don't allow this on your team, or prepare for a slow and painful death as a company.
