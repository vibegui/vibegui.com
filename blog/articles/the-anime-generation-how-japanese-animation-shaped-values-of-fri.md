Those born between 1985-1995 in Brazil had an absolutely unique privilege. TV Manchete (from Rio) was the protagonist in importing Japanese anime here. In doing so, it morally shaped a generation of young people. These cartoons seemed "silly" and comical on the surface, but all of them delivered powerful lessons in every field: the fight of good against evil, the unwavering commitment to your friends, the duty to protect the oppressed, the sacrifice necessary to achieve great results. All these parameters were created for my generation, in large part, because of these shows. For this and other reasons, I am eternally grateful and an admirer of Japanese culture.

The opening song lyrics are evidence, and a show in themselves:

**Yu Yu Hakusho**

*"...But I know how to decide because I grew up*
*I'm strong, I'm ready to fight!*
*I go crazy, and the energy and power will grow*
*And suddenly, a latent desire beats*
*To break limits and dream*
*I go crazy, but a smile makes me understand, know why*
*Someone forgets the pain and finds in love the strength to say*
*Arigatou gozaimasu!"*

**Dragon Ball Z:**

*"I can sense danger and chaos*
*And no one will scare me now*
*With my mind, I go to a thousand places*
*And imagination gives me strength to fly*
*Dreams we wish to achieve*
*To be someone with greater power than you already have*
*Freedom is running through the sky*
*Always united we will triumph*
*And if our fight is for real*
*I'll show my worth*
*My commitment is to always win!"*

**Saint Seiya (Knights of the Zodiac):**

*"There's always someone in the cosmos helping the knight to win*
*And only the winner can wear their golden armor*
*I know this tournament will make our universe tremble*
*Warriors are warriors*
*In the stars is where their treasure lies*
*It's in the constellations that the fight will begin*
*And here good and evil until one of them wins"*

This was a generation of kids who learned the value of friendship and justice, and that it's ALWAYS worth having hope and ACTING. Even when everything seems lost. **Action Creates Hope.**
