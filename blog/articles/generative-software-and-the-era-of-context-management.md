Although we'd like to see ourselves as deliberate artists of precisely constructed systems, the truth is that modern software engineering has been largely about "throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks."

"What sticks" is literally the new code that doesn't completely destroy the production environment (although most of the time it degrades performance) and minimally meets a given product requirement.

Over time, ALL software degrades violently, requiring careful maintenance just to remain functional.

The emergence of AI for programming will multiply by a thousand the amount of software generated by humanity — which will degrade even faster, since there won't be enough humans to maintain it.

This, in turn, will give rise to self-repairing and self-evolving AI software systems. They will completely abandon the promise of control over how software is implemented and fully embrace a specification-based approach. **The plan IS the system.** From there, agents will implement, deploy, test, and monitor as best they can. To improve the system, you'll have only two levers: the plan and the CONTEXT.

This is the role of Context Management in the approaching era of Generative Software.

**Your software will only be as good as your AI. And your AI will only be as good as your Context.**
