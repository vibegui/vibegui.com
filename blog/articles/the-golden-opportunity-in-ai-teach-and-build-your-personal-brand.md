In the next 2 years, those who teach AI clearly will get rich. Those who only consume content will keep complaining that they missed the wave.

Let me explain: if you don't know what to do to make money or you're bored at your job, there's a unique opportunity on the table.

We live in a bubble. Tech Twitter, AI newsletters, YouTube demos. We completely lose perspective on how tunneled this is. Baby, my co-founder, built a LinkedIn scraper looking for people using the word "MCP" in Brazil. Result: 3 people.

While we debate Claude vs GPT, 90% of companies still run on spreadsheets. We're on the flat part of the S-curve, not the steep climb. This means one thing: **you're too early, not too late.**

If you master tools like deco, Lovable, n8n, Cursor, Claude Code, or any AI workflow that actually works, you have gold in your hands.

Here's my invitation: this weekend, create your personal brand. Make tutorials. Teach companies and individuals to use AI productively—not just to make demo chatbots.

Every video you make onboards someone who will pay for consulting, courses, or implementation. Every honest post about what really works positions you as an expert.

The revolution needs translators. People who know how to take the technology and transform it into practical results for those who don't live in the bubble.

**What AI tool do you master that could become 10 tutorials this week?**
