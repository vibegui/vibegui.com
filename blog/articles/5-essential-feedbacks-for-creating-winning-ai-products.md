Today I had the pleasure of being a judge at the "Devs de Impacto" hackathon. It was sensational! At the end, I gave 5 feedbacks for the teams to do even better next time. When I was leaving, one of the participants asked if I could send the feedback, and I committed to writing it down. Here they are:

**1. FOCUS!** Many projects failed by excess. Technology is very powerful and opens many possibilities. But to create a product that wins the market, this is a problem! When you dig around a problem, a bunch of "Also Works For This" appears—it also solves this and that. Forget it! Choose ONE ICP (Ideal Customer Profile), choose ONE pain point (preferably the hair-on-fire type), and make ONE solution (preferably an agent that solves a problem on autopilot).

**2. Changing habits requires economic incentive 99% of the time.** Assuming someone will download your app because it's cool or innovative... unfortunately, is very naive. We are bombarded by ads from companies with deep pockets competing for our attention in a permanent auction. People only stop their lives to do something that makes a HUGE difference to them, generally because it solves an enormous problem (like "I want to get around" or "I want dinner"). Corollary: it's much easier to make something for Companies than for Consumers... there's a lot of quantifiable pain.

**3. Product (and code) is MUCH easier (especially post-AI) than Distribution.** At the hackathon we get excited to see the demo and see that it works. But the real world isn't about the product working—it's about the product working *for an audience that decides to test and adopt.* No audience, no product. Therefore: models that depend on "everyone downloading my app" to work are "dead on arrival." Seek to leverage existing distribution layers. Make current distributors (who already have an audience) have a reason to distribute you.

**4. Capitalism works** (here comes the controversy) — when you think something "should be a certain way," research deeply *why it isn't now*. The more mature a value chain, the greater the chance it's already "optimized," meaning the players have already discovered ways to make it more efficient. If you're seeing a "giant hole," you'd better check three times if there really is a hole, and why you're so brilliant to be seeing it when all the companies and individuals in that sector aren't.

**5. We waste time inventing a bunch of marketplaces and complicated value propositions, but the reality is that Artificial Intelligence offers an absurdly obvious path to generate value: automate an EXISTING ROLE!** A company that spends X thousands of reais per month on "contract review freelancers" will certainly immediately understand the value proposition of a "contract review agent" that costs X/10 and delivers X*2. No need to invent a model: find repetitive work, automate it, and sell.

That's it! Congratulations to all the teams!
