We were taught that "those who prepare and study hard will get a better job." The classic adolescent terror of needing to get into a "good university" because "someone will look at the resume pile and discard you if you're not from the top 5."

And indeed, for a long time, preparing and "obtaining knowledge" to differentiate yourself from others contributed to the appreciation of your time.

But now knowledge comes from the power outlet. You can have a nuclear physicist or a Nobel Prize-winning historian in your pocket.

**The world has always been, in the end, for those who DO, more than those who "KNOW."**

But now, on top of that, the cost of KNOWING is basically zero.

In other words, there's only one true differentiator: DOING.

I feel sorry for the generations of children who will still be born with lag, preparing for school-university-MBA, only to discover that all this preparation is no substitute for ACTION.

*PS: I'm not against studying. I'm against studying as an end. Studying is a means to become capable of DOING something. The cerebral epistemological addiction to accumulating knowledge is the pleasure of those who don't dare fail in the real world—you can't read wrong. But doing is pure repetition of error!*
