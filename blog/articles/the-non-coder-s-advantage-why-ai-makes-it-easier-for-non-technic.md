For the first time ever, there are MANY relevant theses you can pursue without a technical co-founder.

I think it's easier for a non-coder to use AI to put a system into production than for a coder to use AI to "gain business sense."

Reason: non-coders want to solve the problem and need to know how to express themselves in code. Coders know how to express themselves and don't care much about the problem, as long as it's fun to solve.

AI is very good at bridging skill gaps, but it's not capable of changing what excites a person.

That said: if you're a coder, you can decide to get excited about solving problems. It's literally just experimenting, and you'll see it's much more fun and addictive than just mastering the machine.
