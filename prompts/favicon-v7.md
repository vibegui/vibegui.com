# Favicon v7 - DNA Helix Wave

Generated with Nano Banana (google/gemini-2.5-flash-image) via OpenRouter MCP.

## Prompt

```
Create a square digital artwork with perfectly sharp 90-degree corners. Deep forest green background (hex #1a4d3e).

The image shows a DNA double helix structure viewed from the side, flowing horizontally from left edge to right edge. Two interweaving sine waves that cross each other periodically, like a twisted ladder or the classic DNA helix shape.

The helix is made entirely of circular dots of varying sizes. The dots form both the spiral strands AND fill the space between the strands with smaller connector dots, creating a mesh or grid effect within the helix shape.

The entire canvas is covered with dots in a grid pattern like GitHub's contribution graph. The dots that form the DNA helix are bright glowing lime-green (hex #c4e538). The dots in the background and further from the helix are progressively darker, creating a gradient glow effect. The helix appears to emit light.

The DNA helix should be LARGE and PROMINENT, filling approximately 70-80% of the vertical space. The helix completes about 1-2 full twists across the width of the image.

Scattered floating particles (random bright dots) surround the main helix structure, adding depth and a cosmic feel.

The overall effect should match this aesthetic: a glowing DNA helix made of particle dots on a dark green background, similar to data visualization or bioinformatics imagery.

Monochromatic green palette only - ranging from very dark forest green to bright lime-green. No other colors.

Sharp square corners, absolutely no rounded edges or border radius. No text, no labels. 512x512 pixels. High quality digital art.

## Post-processing

The generated 1024x1024 image was center-cropped to 700x700 to focus more on the helix pattern, then resized to various favicon sizes.
