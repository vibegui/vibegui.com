It works like this: There is a list of angel investors, each with a curated profile, beautiful profile image, description of experience and expertise, and categorized between industries, stages, etc. also if operator or investor/vc or etc... so we have this list, you can browse it, but you cant contact these angels directly. on the top of the site, there is a prompt box. \"Write a max 10k word prompt pitching your startup. anjo agent will carefully research you and your thesis and present it to every relevant angel. They will get your contact details and will let you know if they want to talk\". The entire web app is just a thin SPA, super high performance, tailwind, etc, over a public MCP server. this MCP server has tools like \"list top angels\" which has the main 8 profiles we display on home page. also \"search angels\" which is the page where i can have a proper gallery with filters like an ecommerce. and then \"angel detail\" which is the \"product page\" for this angel. all of this is templated over structured data. you should include a mock mcp server that returns a mock list of angels now so we can fully develop the frontend first. Also, the colors are bright yellow, inspired in brazil, and white, and very dark grey for text. mostly angellic like you know, but BR first. tones of green subtly. there is also an \"apply for angel\" button which asks for your linkedin url and sends a form to this MCP in another tool. The home page is like a big hero saying \"Nothing is heavy with wings\" - and then a sub text describing generally the platform. along with the prompt you need to send your linkedin profile, its an input right below the prompt box. after the hero with the prompt box, there is a mini-gallery of 8 select angels and a button to \"browse all angels\". after that, there is an informative section with a diagram and a text explaining: \"The first investment is the most important leap of faith, and knowledgeable angels play an integral part in the startup investment ecosystem. They are the first layer of de-risking and selection of viable thesis. anjo.chat is a public service to accelerate the creation of high-growth tech companies in Brazil. We help efficiently connect founders to angels that can help much beyond money: with guidance, connections and important advice they wish they had sooner about their market or industry.\" then finally there is an \"ad\" section for decocms.com - this is an initiative by the decocms.com team and is implemented using deco mcp mesh - star us on github: https://github.com/decocms/mesh\n\n## Technical Stack\n- Next.js SPA\n- Tailwind with Brazil-inspired palette (bright yellow, white, dark grey, subtle green)\n- Public MCP server for all data operations\n- Supabase for database\n\n## V1 Requirements\n\n### Angel Recruitment\n- Scrape own LinkedIn, sort by shared connections\n- Identify good matches from cap table and WhatsApp contacts\n- Send personal WhatsApp invitations\n\n### Angel Onboarding Form\n- Public form to collect: LinkedIn profile, picture, interests, check size range (optional), # of previous investments (optional)\n- Stored in new Supabase org\n- Admin review + approval before angel appears in list\n\n### Startup Submissions\n- Table for startup prompt submissions\n- Extract: startup name, URL from prompt\n- Anti-spam: reject multiple entries from same startup\n\n### AI Matching Workflow (MCP Mesh Native)\n1.
