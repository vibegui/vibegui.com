# The Future as Context: The Domain of Leadership

## Overview

Leader and leadership exist in the temporal domain of a **created future**. Understanding how the future functions as a context for the present is essential for understanding why leadership matters and how it operates.

## The Nature of Future

There are many kinds of futures people think about:
- Future as **goal** (toward which one strives)
- Future as **hoped-for** or **pipe dream**
- Future as **feared** or **worried-about**
- Future as **to be avoided**

However, one kind of future does **not** exist: future as **certain**. The future is never certain; it exists only as possibility.

## The Default Future: Past-Derived

The future that exerts the most force on the present is **future as given by the past** - extrapolated or projected from how the past has unfolded.

While people may have various hopes, dreams, worries, and goals, the future that actually impacts their way of being and actions is **the future into which they are living**.

### Why the Past-Derived Future Dominates

Neuroscience explains this: The brain, below the level of consciousness, only has patterns from the past to predict the future. The brain then shapes a person's way of being and action in the present to be consistent with realizing that predicted future.

> *Brain activity selects an action even before the person consciously experiences choosing that action.*

This explains why, for most people, life is "business as usual":
- They may do **more** of what they've done (still the past)
- They may do what they've done but **better** (still the past)
- They may do something **different** (still connected to the past)
- They may **change** (but change requires a past from which to change)

## The Illusion of Choice

Most people believe they have many choices about what they can do. This is a delusion.

The more we learn about the brain, the clearer it becomes: our opportunity set for being, thinking, planning, and action in the present is limited to choices consistent with realizing the past-derived future we live into.

The illusion of unlimited choice leaves people without incentive to discover how to transform the grip of the past-derived future on the present. They go blissfully on, attributing life's unworkability to "just the way life is."

> *"The more things change, the more they stay the same."* — French proverb

## Future as Context

The future a person is living into is the **context** for their life in the present:
- What is so in the present occurs in that context
- Possibilities for dealing with what is so occur in that context
- Context distorts what we see and how we see it

### Being Blind-Sided

Because context shapes perception, we never know:
- What conditions don't show up for us at all
- What distortions occur in how things appear

Being "blind-sided" is one of the most prevalent destroyers of effective leadership.

## The Context Is Decisive

One way or another, the future that gets realized is some variation of the future you and those you lead are living into.

If that context is the past-derived default future:
- The brain selects ways of being and acting that will realize that future
- You may win some battles, but you will lose the war
- Results will be more of the same - more, better, different, changed - but still connected to the past

**This is why leadership matters.**

## Created Future vs. Past-Derived Future

A future derived from the past is not a "created future." Extensions and extrapolations are **changes**, not **creations**.

Leadership exists in the domain of a **created future** - a future that is invented, not extended from the past.

### When Leadership Is Required

If the mission can be realized within the context of a future given by the past (drawing on the past, doing more, better, or different), leadership is not required. Effective management will suffice.

**Leadership is required when:**
- A new context is needed
- A future beyond what the past makes possible is required
- Doing more, better, different, or even changing is insufficient
- Without a transformation of the future being lived into, results will be more of the same

## The Cosmic Joke

First line: *The past has nothing to do with who you are or the way you act in the present!*

Second line: *The present is given by the future into which you are living!*

Question: *If the past doesn't impact the present, why does everyone believe it does?*

Punch line: *If the present is given by the future, and you put the past into the future, it will seem like the past is shaping the present!*

It's as if there's a two-drawer file cabinet - one labeled "past," one labeled "future" - and you unwittingly file your past in the future drawer.

### The Conclusion

> *"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."* — George Santayana

> *"Those who envision the future based on the past are also condemned to repeat it."* — Werner Erhard

If you leave the past in the past (complete it), while being informed by it, you can create a future to live into.

## Making Room for a Created Future

To create a new future, you must:
1. Get clear about the almost-certain future that would be realized without intervention
2. Accept that without a new context, that past-derived future really is what will happen
3. Remove the significance from that default future
4. Complete living into it (it becomes just another possible future, not *the* future)
5. This makes space in the "future drawer" for a created future

## Key Insights for Leaders

1. **The future you live into shapes the present** - Not the past, but how you hold the future

2. **The default future comes from the past** - Brain patterns predict based on past experience

3. **Leadership transforms context** - By creating a new future to live into

4. **Management works within existing context** - Leadership is needed only when context itself must change

5. **Complete the past to free the future** - Filing the past where it belongs opens space for creation

6. **The context is decisive** - Whatever context is in place determines what's possible
