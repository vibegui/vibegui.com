# Authenticity: The Second Foundation of Leadership

## Overview

Authenticity is the second of four foundational factors for being a leader and exercising leadership effectively. Like integrity, authenticity in this model is not about being "good" or "right" - it is simply required for effective leadership.

## The Core Definition

**Being Authentic** = Being and acting consistent with:
1. Who you hold yourself out to be for others
2. Who you hold yourself to be for yourself

This includes who you allow others to hold you to be.

## The Path to Authenticity

The path to authenticity is counterintuitive:

> *The path to authenticity is being authentic about your inauthenticities.*

You cannot become authentic by trying to be authentic on top of your inauthenticities. As the course metaphor puts it: "Attempting to be authentic on top of your inauthenticities is like putting cake frosting on cow dung, thinking that will make the cow dung go down well."

## Universal Human Inauthenticities

Most of us think of ourselves as authentic, yet each of us is consistently inauthentic in certain situations and certain ways. This is part of being human. The key insight from Chris Argyris after four decades of research:

> "Put simply, people consistently act inconsistently, unaware of the contradiction between their espoused theory and their theory-in-use, between the way they think they are acting and the way they really act."

### Common Sources of Inauthenticity

**The Need for Admiration**
- Admiration is "the highest coin in the realm"
- We will do almost anything to be admired
- We readily fudge on being straightforward when we perceive a threat to admiration
- The loss of authenticity seems like a small price - especially when we don't notice it

**The Need to Appear Loyal**
- We often act "loyal" solely to avoid losing admiration
- We sacrifice authenticity to maintain the pretense of loyalty
- True loyalty requires authenticity, not performance

**The Need to Look Good**
- Most of us have a "pathetic need for looking good"
- We pretend to have followed and understood things when we haven't
- Paradoxically: looking good does not look good
- Being defensive, posturing, or petulant also does not look good

**Fear of Looking Bad**
- Fear of appearing wrong, stupid, irrational, naive, or silly
- This fear destroys even the possibility of being authentic
- Results in being defensive, posturing, or childishly sulking

## The Cost of Inauthenticity

Being inauthentic about being wrong (or any inauthenticity) costs you the power required to be a leader and exercise leadership effectively.

If you're going to be a leader, you need the courage to be straight when you're wrong, stupid, irrational, naive, or silly - **and you will be**.

## Each Person is Inauthentic

This description applies to everyone, including instructors and recognized leaders. We are all "guilty of being small in these ways - it comes with being human."

What distinguishes great leaders is not eliminating these weaknesses but:
- Coming to grips with these foibles of being human
- Being the master of these weaknesses when leading
- Recognizing inauthenticity when it occurs
- Being willing to confront it

As Bill George (former Medtronic CEO, Harvard Business School Professor of Leadership) states:

> "After years of studying leaders and their traits, I believe that leadership begins and ends with authenticity."

## Signs You Are Being Inauthentic

You may catch yourself being limited in performance, or stuck, due to:
- Fear of loss of admiration
- Fear of being accused of being disloyal
- Fear of looking bad

Such fear might stop you from doing something as simple as raising your hand to ask a question.

## Distinguishing Inauthenticity Creates Power

The opportunity is to:
1. Recognize your inauthenticities (you won't like seeing them)
2. Distinguish these weaknesses in yourself
3. Be authentic about your inauthenticities
4. This is the pathway to authenticity

Without recognizing when you're being inauthentic, and without willingness to confront it, you have no chance of being authentic.

## Key Insights for Leaders

1. **Authenticity is critical for leadership** - Not because it's virtuous, but because it's required for effective exercise of leadership

2. **Inauthenticity is a barrier** - Both to being a leader and to the effective exercise of leadership

3. **Self-deception is universal** - We are mostly inauthentic about being inauthentic, "fooling ourselves about fooling ourselves"

4. **Welcome uncomfortable insights** - They are opportunities for growth

5. **The courage to be straight** - Leadership requires being honest about mistakes, limitations, and uncertainties
