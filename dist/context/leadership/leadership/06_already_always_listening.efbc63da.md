# Already-Always Listening: An Ontological Perceptual Constraint

## Overview

Already-Always Listening is one of the most prevalent and limiting perceptual constraints on leadership. If not dealt with powerfully, it will prevent you from realizing your potential as a leader.

## The Core Insight

Most of us assume that whatever someone says enters our ears and registers in our listening exactly as it was said. This is false.

**The distinction:** There is a difference between what we **hear** (what enters our ears) and what we **listen** (what lands for us).

Our listening is not an empty vessel. It is not a blank slate. Something is already there in our listening before we hear anything - and it is always there. Hence the name: **already-always listening**.

## How It Works

### The Constraining Effect
Your already-always listening constrains what registers for you. Anything said that is inconsistent with your existing judgments, evaluations, or opinions will either:
- Not register for you at all
- Be dismissed in some way

**Example:** If you have an opinion that conservative politicians don't empathize with suffering, and one says something empathetic, it is unlikely to register for you as empathy.

### The Shaping Effect
Beyond constraining, your already-always listening shapes (distorts) what does register to be consistent with your existing views.

**Example:** If that same politician speaks about addressing suffering, you might interpret it as having an "alternative agenda" rather than genuine concern.

## Everyday Examples

Consider someone in your life for whom you have an already-always listening - some favorable or unfavorable judgment, evaluation, or opinion that exists **before that person even opens their mouth**.

That already-always listening constrains and shapes whatever they say:
- The judgment is already there before they speak
- It is always there until you change it
- Whatever they say is filtered to be consistent with your judgment
- It becomes unlikely you will ever change that judgment

## Group Already-Always Listening

Each nationality, culture, religion, family, and tight-knit group has an identifiable already-always listening shared by most members.

While we may easily identify the already-always listening of *other* groups, most of us are unaware of our own group's listening.

**You are shaped by your listening as:**
- A member of your nationality
- A male, female, or gender non-binary person
- A member of your religion
- Part of your particular family (distinct from other families)
- An individual with idiosyncratic listening

## Beyond Just Listening

While we name this "already-always listening," it extends to all perception. **You** are not an empty vessel - not just your listening, but your entire perception of whatever you're dealing with.

This could equally be called **already-always interpreting** - there are already-there interpretations in "the way you wound up being" that constrain and shape what you perceive.

## The Hidden Controller

Because your already-always listening is **already there** and **always there**, it is like air to the bird and water to the fish. We do not notice what is omnipresent.

> *What you don't distinguish (what you're unaware of) runs you.*

Your way of being and your actions are correlated with how things occur for you. When undistinguished already-always listening imposes distortions:
- Your being and actions correlate with those distortions
- Not with what was actually said
- You are unaware of this manipulation
- You try to be effective with a distortion of reality
- You ascribe false causes to any difficulties

## The Leader's Requirement

> *To be a leader and exercise leadership effectively as your natural self-expression, you must distinguish your already-always listening - or when you are leading, it will run you.*

When undistinguished, your already-always listening:
- Distorts what you perceive
- Generates false causes for breakdowns
- Has you "fixing" things that aren't the real problem
- Creates circular, repetitive patterns of dysfunction

## Distinguishing the Constraint

The first step is simply awareness:
- Recognize that you have already-always listening
- Begin to identify what it is in specific situations
- Notice when your reactions might be shaped by prior judgments
- Question whether what you perceived was what was actually communicated

## Key Insights for Leaders

1. **Listening is not passive reception** - It is an active process shaped by existing patterns

2. **You are not a neutral observer** - Your perceptions are always already filtered

3. **Awareness creates choice** - What you distinguish, you can work with; what you don't distinguish runs you

4. **Group listening is often invisible** - Cultural and social filters are the hardest to see

5. **False causes lead to circular problems** - When you don't see the real constraint, you "fix" the wrong things repeatedly

6. **This applies to everything** - Not just listening, but reading, studying, and all forms of perception
