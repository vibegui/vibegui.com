# Being Given Being and Action by Something Bigger Than Yourself: The Third Foundation

## Overview

The third foundation for leader and leadership is being given being and action by something bigger than oneself. This is the source of the **serene passion** required to lead, to develop others as leaders, and the source of **persistence** when the path gets tough.

## The Core Insight

> *All true leaders are heroes - and heroes are ordinary people who are given being and action by something bigger than themselves.*

This is not about being born extraordinary. It is about what gives you your being and action.

## Heroes Are Ordinary People

We learn about great leaders after they have succeeded. In hindsight, they appear extraordinary. However, when the full story is told:

- Every great leader was an ordinary person
- What made them extraordinary was being given being and action by something bigger than themselves
- To assume great leaders started out extraordinary demeans what it took for them to transcend "who they wound up being"

**The danger of believing leaders are born extraordinary:** If you think you need to be extraordinary to be a leader, that gives you no access to being a leader.

## The Essential Question

> *Does whatever your life is about, and whatever your career is about, and whatever your relationships are about, need you to be bigger than the way you "wound up being"?*

What is your life about? Really?

## What This Requires

If you aspire to be a great leader:
- Your life must be about something bigger than yourself
- Your career must be about something bigger than your personal concerns
- Your relationships must be about something bigger than your hopes, dreams, and grand ideas as "the person you wound up being"

This includes being about something bigger than:
- Personal fame
- Position
- Authority
- Money

**If personal gain is what gives you being and action, you can forget about being a leader.**

## The Choice

Each person must make the choice for themselves:
- To be a hero or not
- To be a leader or not
- To have the purpose of life, career, and relationships be about something bigger than oneself

Note: This is a genuine choice. People you lead may be committed to nothing more than their personal concerns. You cannot be effective if you make their current state wrong. Start with where they are, then lead them to something greater.

## The Valley of the Shadow of Death

On the way to greatness, every great leader faces times of being massively thwarted, left with:
- A sense of hopelessness
- A profound feeling of inadequacy for the task
- The world occurring as immovable, impossible
- Nothing to give, nothing to draw on
- No help, no way

At these times, giving up or quitting seems like the only viable option.

**The key insight:** In these moments, you need something already in place that is bigger than yourself and your circumstances to generate the being and action required to get through.

Don't wait until you find yourself in the "valley of the shadow of death" to establish what your life is about.

## Taking a Stand

> *Are you a stand for something beyond yourself - something you are willing to give your life to? Without that, for you there will be no chance of greatness.*

This is not about sacrifice or suffering. It is about what gives meaning and power to your actions.

## The Relationship to Other Foundations

Something Bigger provides:
- The **serene passion** to lead (not frantic desperation, but calm certainty)
- The **persistence** when things get difficult
- The **context** that makes sense of effort and setback

Combined with Integrity, Authenticity, and Being Cause in the Matter, this foundation provides genuine power for leadership.

## Key Insights for Leaders

1. **Ordinariness is the starting point** - No one is born a leader; it emerges from what gives you being and action

2. **Personal gain disqualifies** - If your actions are primarily motivated by personal benefit, leadership will not be available

3. **The source of persistence** - What gets you through impossible moments is already having something bigger than yourself in place

4. **It's a choice, not an assignment** - No one can make this choice for you, and no choice is inherently more righteous than another - but the consequences differ

5. **Lead people from where they are** - Others may not share your commitment to something bigger; start with their actual commitments
