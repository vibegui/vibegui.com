# Authentic Listening: The Power of Getting Others

## Overview

One of the most powerful means of functioning in the sphere of language (where leadership exists) is through a certain kind of listening. Authentic listening is how masters listen, and it creates the experience of "being gotten" - a fundamentally transformative experience for those being led.

## What Authentic Listening Requires

Authentic listening means listening to another person without any of:
- Your own positions
- Your views and opinions
- Rationalizations and justifications
- Judgments
- Significant history with that person
- Anything else you're stuck with that could get in the way

The goal is to leave the speaker **complete**.

## Effective Leaders Listen

An effective leader listens to all of what those they are leading have to say about:
- The way things are
- Why they are that way
- What's wrong with all that
- Solutions they have had
- The hoped-for or dreamt-of future
- The resigned-to, worried-about, or feared future
- The future given to them by authority
- The we-will-work-hard-for-it future

## Leaving the Speaker "Complete"

Shallow meaning: The speaker has said everything they have to say and has nothing more to add.

Deeper meaning: The speaker has the experience of actually **being gotten** - not just listened to, not just understood, but gotten.

This means: Where you the listener are, there is an **exact duplication** of what exists where the speaker is.

## Getting vs. Understanding

There is a distinction between:
- Being **heard** (sounds were received)
- Being **understood** (meaning was intellectually processed)
- Being **gotten** (full recreation of the speaker's reality)

Until people are gotten, they will keep repeating themselves - even under their breath. When you've achieved authentic listening, people stop repeating themselves.

## What Gets in the Way

Any of these in your listening will prevent getting:
- Resistance to what's being expressed
- Opinions about the speaker
- "I already know what you're saying"
- Adding to what they're saying:
  - Assuming meanings beyond what's said
  - Drawing conclusions
  - Extrapolating
  - Worrying about or disapproving
  - Judging
  - Listening for whether you agree
  - Making something out of how they say it

## The Key Requirement

> *You have to get what is being said without adding or subtracting anything from what is being said.*

This is not about agreeing with them. It is about recreating their reality as **the** reality - not "a" reality or "their" reality, but **the** reality.

You cannot be listening from what's real "for them." Leave the "for them" out. You are neither agreeing nor disagreeing - you are **recreating another**.

## The State of Mind

Abraham Zaleznik (Harvard Business School Professor of Leadership) on leadership state of mind:

> "Leadership cannot be taught. But would-be leaders can develop a state of mind that enhances leadership capacities. The particular state of mind that interests me... begins with the capacity to listen and deepen one's understanding of another person's point of view. The impulse to argue is contrary to the state of mind that encourages listening."

## Why Being Gotten Matters

What keeps people stuck with their strongly held positions is the experience of **not being gotten**.

If your listening includes any subtle resistance, opinion, "I already know," or addition to what they're saying, you add to their experience of not being gotten.

When people are gotten:
- The experience creates some emptiness where they are
- They can let go of positions they were holding rigidly
- New possibilities become available
- Something shifts

## You Cannot Fake It

Recent neuroscience has discovered **mirror neurons** - neurons that mirror the activity patterns of another person you're observing.

When someone watches you listen, their mirror neurons record:
- Your facial expressions
- Your posture
- Your patterns of movement
- What you say in dialogue
- Who you are being as a listener

This recorded pattern is compared with the speaker's stored patterns from when they themselves have listened (authentically and inauthentically).

**The result:** No matter how clever you are, you cannot fake authentic listening. The speaker's brain will detect if you're pretending.

## How to Listen Authentically

Listen with nothing between you and the speaker, so that what comes from them:
- Is not distorted by anything in the space between you
- Does not have to go through any labyrinth of your evaluations or judgments before landing

If you are authentically committed to recreating what exists where the speaker is, they will be left with the experience of having been gotten.

## Authentic Listening Requires Authenticity

The kind of listening that leaves people gotten requires you to be completely authentic. The speaker has also pretended to listen in the past - their mirror neurons will recognize the match with their own patterns of pretended authenticity.

By contrast, the speaker also has stored patterns of genuine authentic listening - perhaps from when someone they cared about expressed love for them. Even if that was as a child, the pattern exists for comparison.

## Key Insights for Leaders

1. **Getting creates opening** - People let go when they're truly gotten

2. **Understanding is not enough** - Intellectual processing doesn't create the same shift

3. **Nothing between you and speaker** - Any filter distorts and is detected

4. **You cannot add or subtract** - Pure recreation of their reality

5. **Mirror neurons make faking impossible** - Authenticity is required

6. **Completion stops repetition** - When gotten, people stop repeating themselves

7. **It's a powerful leadership tool** - Transforms what's possible in relationships and situations
