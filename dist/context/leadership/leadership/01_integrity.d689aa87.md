# Integrity: The First Foundation of Leadership

## Overview

Integrity is the first of four foundational factors for being a leader and exercising leadership effectively. In this model, integrity is treated as a **positive phenomenon** (descriptive, like physics) rather than a normative concept (prescriptive, like ethics). Just as the law of gravity simply describes how objects behave, the Law of Integrity describes how performance correlates with wholeness and completeness.

## The Core Definition

**Integrity** = Being whole and complete; nothing hidden, no deceit, no pretense.

A person has integrity when their word is whole and complete. An object has integrity when it is whole and complete - a bicycle with missing parts lacks integrity and will not perform optimally.

## The Six Components of One's Word

What constitutes "your word" is far more comprehensive than most people realize:

### Word 1: What You Said
Your explicit statements, commitments, and promises to others. This is what most people limit their understanding of "word" to.

### Word 2: What You Know
What you know to do or not to do, and the way you know it should be done. Even if you never explicitly said it, this is part of your word.

### Word 3: What Is Expected
What others would expect you to do based on the context, relationship, and circumstances - even if never explicitly stated.

### Word 4: What You Say Is So (Assertions)
The accuracy and truthfulness of your statements about reality, facts, and situations.

### Word 5: What You Stand For
Your expressed or implied values, principles, and standards of behavior that you hold yourself to.

### Word 6: Moral, Ethical, and Legal Standards
The standards of behavior and conduct accepted by relevant groups, organizations, and society.

## Keeping vs. Honoring Your Word

A crucial distinction: **Integrity is not simply keeping your word.**

### Keeping Your Word
Doing what you said you would do, on time.

### Honoring Your Word
When you cannot keep your word (or choose not to), you maintain integrity by:
1. **Acknowledging** as soon as you realize you won't keep it
2. **Informing** all affected parties promptly
3. **Taking responsibility** for the impact on others
4. **Dealing with consequences** - cleaning up any mess created

This distinction is critical because treating integrity as only "keeping your word" creates an impossible standard that leaves no way to maintain integrity when circumstances prevent keeping a commitment.

## The Law of Integrity (Ontological)

> *As the integrity of an object, system, person, or other entity is diminished, the opportunity for performance of that object, system, person, or other entity is diminished.*

This works through a cascade:

**Integrity → Workability → Performance**

- **Integrity** creates **Workability** (things functioning as designed)
- **Workability** creates the **Opportunity for Performance**
- Without integrity, maximum performance is not possible

This is not a moral claim but a descriptive one: like a car with missing parts, a person or organization lacking integrity simply cannot perform at their potential.

## The Veil of Invisibility

Eleven factors make integrity violations invisible to us:

1. **Not seeing that who you are is your word** - Identity is constituted by keeping your word
2. **Limiting word to only explicit promises** - Ignoring Words 2-6
3. **Treating integrity as a virtue** - Making it about being good rather than workability
4. **Self-deception about being out of integrity** - We see our "reasons" not our failures
5. **Believing integrity is only keeping your word** - No path to restore when broken
6. **Fear of acknowledging failures** - Missing the power of honest acknowledgment
7. **Not seeing integrity as a factor of production** - Creating false causes for failures
8. **Not doing cost/benefit analysis when giving your word** - Irresponsible promising
9. **Doing cost/benefit analysis when honoring your word** - Treating commitments as conditional
10. **Not recognizing integrity is a mountain with no top** - Expecting to "arrive" at integrity
11. **Not having your word exist when it comes time to keep it** - No system for tracking commitments

## A Picture of Integrity

Imagine your life if:
- You have done what you said you would do, on time
- You have done what you know to do, the way it was meant to be done, on time
- You have met others' expectations, or informed them you would not
- You have made your expectations of others explicit
- Whenever you couldn't do any of the above, you acknowledged it promptly, stated when you would complete it, and dealt with all consequences

And imagine if others operated this way with you.

## Key Insights for Leaders

1. **Integrity is privately optimal** - It pays to behave with integrity even if others don't, because you become trustworthy
2. **Integrity is not about being a Pollyanna** - You can have integrity and still not trust those who lack it
3. **Integrity creates power** - The degree of integrity you have equals the amount of power you have
4. **"Learn to enjoy climbing"** - Since integrity is a mountain with no top, joy must come from the process, not arrival

## The Golden Rule vs. Integrity

The Golden Rule ("do unto others...") leaves you dependent on others' goodwill. Integrity is actionable, does not require others' cooperation, and still generates trust and workability. The result is greater performance, value, and quality of life.
