# Being Cause in the Matter: The Fourth Foundation of Leadership

## Overview

Being Cause in the Matter is the fourth foundational factor for being a leader. It provides a uniquely powerful place from which to view, comprehend, and deal with any situation a leader confronts.

## The Core Challenge

When being a leader and exercising leadership, you must deal with "the condition" - the facts and circumstances of the situation you face.

**Critical insight:** It is the way in which you **relate** to the situation, rather than the situation itself, that is critical to effective leadership.

## The Default Position: At Effect

By default, if you did not directly cause the circumstances you face, you will relate to them as being "at effect":
- You had no choice about these circumstances
- You must deal with them anyway
- This leaves you fundamentally reactive
- You may even be annoyed, making you more "at effect"

Even if you competently deal with circumstances while "at effect," you are unlikely to be powerful as a leader or extraordinary in exercising leadership.

## The Nature of Power

- If you have the power to cause what happens, that's power
- To the degree you are at effect, you lack power
- This is not a moral judgment - just an observation about capability
- Unfortunately, the situations where you most need power are often those where you lack it

## Being Cause in the Matter: A Declaration, Not an Assertion

**Crucial distinction:**

- **Assertion:** A statement of fact (you actually caused these conditions)
- **Declaration:** A place to stand from which to view and relate to facts

Being Cause in the Matter is used as a **declaration** - a chosen context, not a factual claim.

You are not claiming you caused the conditions. You are choosing a place to stand that gives you a different relationship to them.

## What It Is NOT

Being Cause in the Matter is not:
- Fault
- Blame
- Shame
- Guilt
- Burden
- Obligation
- Credit
- Praise

For many people, "you caused it" can only mean blame or credit. But in this usage, cause has no relation to assigning blame, fault, credit, or reward.

In exercising leadership, who is at fault or to blame, or who gets credit, conveys no power. It is more likely to be disempowering.

## The Full Definition

> *"Being cause-in-the-matter is a context from which one chooses to live. Being cause-in-the-matter is not burden, fault, praise, blame, credit, shame or guilt - there is no evaluation of good or bad, right or wrong. There is simply what's so, and your stand.*

> *Being cause-in-the-matter starts with the willingness to deal with a situation from the view of life that you are the generator of what you do, what you have and what you are. That is not the truth. It is a place to stand.*

> *No one can make you cause-in-the-matter, nor can you impose being cause-in-the-matter on another. It is a grace you give yourself - an empowering context that leaves you with a say in the matter of life."*
> — Werner Erhard

## The Universal Application

**There is nothing that you cannot be cause-in-the-matter of.**

Remember: This is not a conclusion you reach based on observation. It is a stand you take (a context you create) so that the facts of your situation occur for you in a new world.

## How It Creates a New World

When you take the stand of being cause in the matter:
- The same facts exist
- But they occur differently for you
- New possibilities become visible
- New actions become available
- You are no longer at the effect of circumstances

This is the Kuhn sense of "new world" - the same reality, but seen and experienced fundamentally differently.

## The Connection to Power

When you have as your foundation:
1. Being a person of integrity
2. Being authentic
3. Being given being and action by something bigger than yourself
4. Being cause in the matter

**You have given yourself a foundation that is truly powerful.**

- When I do not honor my word, I diminish power
- The less authenticity I have, the less power I have
- When my life is about nothing more than my personal concerns, I have little power
- When I am "at effect," I have no power

## Key Insights for Leaders

1. **It's a choice, not a fact** - You choose this context; you don't prove it

2. **Power comes from the stand** - Not from actually having caused events

3. **Eliminates victim thinking** - Not by denying circumstances, but by changing your relationship to them

4. **Requires giving up blame** - You cannot be both cause in the matter and a victim of others' actions

5. **It's a grace you give yourself** - No one can impose it on you, and you cannot force it on others

6. **Universal applicability** - Any situation, any circumstance, can be addressed from this stand
