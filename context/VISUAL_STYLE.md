## Core Aesthetic

**Retro Comic Hero meets Digital Noir** — The visual identity draws from 1950s-60s comic book art (Marvel/DC golden age), action hero aesthetics, combined with dark digital effects. Think vintage superhero panels reimagined through a CRT monitor with heavy dithering.

**Vibe**: Bold, heroic, retro-futuristic, gritty, action-oriented, technically stylized.

## Color Palette

| Role | Hex | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Background** | `#1a4d3e` | Deep forest green — dark, noir, grounding |
| **Accent/Glow** | `#c4e538` | Bright lime green — radioactive, powerful, alive |
| **Mid-tones** | Interpolate between the two | For gradients and dithering |

**Rule**: Monochromatic green palette ONLY. No other colors. Range from very dark forest green to bright lime-green. The green tones evoke night vision, old computer monitors, radioactive energy, and classic sci-fi.
