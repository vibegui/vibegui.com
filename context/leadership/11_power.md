# Power: The Result of the Foundations

## Overview

Power, in the context of leadership, is not force or coercion. It is the freedom to be and act effectively. The four foundations of leadership - integrity, authenticity, being given being by something bigger, and being cause in the matter - provide access to genuine power.

## What Power Is

Charles Reich's description captures the essence:

> "Power means to me pretty much the same thing as freedom. Power is a thing that everybody wants the most that they can possibly have of. Skiing is power, sex appeal is power, the ability to make yourself heard by your Congressperson is power. Anything that comes out of you and goes out into the world is power."

More specifically:
> "By 'power' I mean human faculties exercised to the largest possible degree."

And critically:
> "When you reach out to another person through the energy or creativity that is in you and that other person responds, you are exercising power. When you make somebody else do something against their will, to me that is not power at all, that is force, and force to me is the negation of power."

## Definitions of Power

Multiple aspects of power in leadership:

- **Ability to allow things to happen** - Not forcing, but enabling
- **Size of intentions divided by time to realization** - Scope and speed of impact
- **The scope and magnitude of your word realized** - Your word becoming reality
- **Altering the occurring** - Shifting how situations appear for yourself and others, leading to different ways of being and acting
- **The freedom to be and act** - Unconstrained access to all possibilities

## Power and the Foundations

Each foundation relates directly to power:

### Integrity and Power
> *The degree of integrity I have is equal to the amount of power I have.*

When you do not honor your word, you diminish power. Integrity creates workability, and workability creates the opportunity for performance.

### Authenticity and Power
> *The less authenticity I have, the less power I have.*

Inauthenticity constrains you. When you're performing rather than being, energy goes to maintaining the performance rather than creating results.

### Something Bigger and Power
> *When my life is about nothing more than my own personal concerns, I have little power.*

Being given being and action by something bigger creates the serene passion and persistence that generates power through difficult times.

### Being Cause in the Matter and Power
> *When I am "at effect" I have no power.*

When you're at effect, you're reactive. Being cause in the matter is the stand that gives you a say in how things go.

## The Foundation Provides Access to Power

> *When you have as your foundation being a person of integrity, being authentic, being given being and action by something bigger than yourself, and being cause-in-the-matter, you have given yourself a foundation that is truly powerful.*

This is not a technique or strategy - it is who you are standing on a solid foundation.

## Power vs. Force

The distinction is essential:

**Power:**
- Comes from you and goes into the world
- Creates response and resonance in others
- Is the exercise of human faculties fully
- Includes the ability to be open, receive, respond
- Creates rather than compels

**Force:**
- Makes someone do something against their will
- Is the negation of power
- Creates resistance and resentment
- Depletes rather than generates
- Requires constant expenditure

## Key Insights for Leaders

1. **Power is freedom** - Not control over others, but access to all possibilities

2. **Force negates power** - Compelling others is not leadership

3. **Power comes from the foundations** - Integrity, authenticity, something bigger, being cause

4. **Power enables response** - When you exercise power, others respond; they're not coerced

5. **At effect = no power** - The foundations move you from effect to cause

6. **Power is exercisable** - It's about your faculties being expressed, not suppressed
