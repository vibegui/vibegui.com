# Life Sentences: A Functional Constraint on Leadership

## Overview

A Life Sentence is a judgment you make, or another makes and you take on, about you or about life, that is made in a moment of stress or vulnerability and with some degree of unconsciousness. This judgment becomes an already/always part of your worldview about yourself or about life.

Life Sentences become idiosyncratic contexts that shape and limit your life. They constitute aspects of your everyday common-sense worldview and frames of reference, and act as barriers to your natural self-expression.

## Why "Life Sentence"?

The term captures a double meaning:

1. **A sentence you uttered** - An actual statement you said (probably to yourself) in a highly charged emotional state
2. **A sentence you serve** - A life-long imprisonment within the constraints of that judgment

It is as though you were the prosecuting attorney, jury, and judge all rolled into one (with a threatened, immature child as the defense attorney) in a trial that passed judgment on the nature of life - and sentenced yourself to live within the confines of whatever you said.

## How Life Sentences Form

### The Conditions Required

For a decision to become a Life Sentence, the moment must include:
- **Threat, shock, or stress**
- **Confusion, doubt, or bewilderment** (something below the level of consciousness)
- **Immaturity** - Most are made as a child or adolescent

### The Mechanism

Because this sentence is uttered in a highly charged mental/emotional state, it becomes for the brain the pattern through which life is then filtered. It becomes for you the "truth" about the way life actually is - not as a decision you made, but as fact.

Being the "truth" for you, these decisions:
- Constrain your opportunity set for life and living
- Limit the possibilities that life and living are for you
- Become self-fulfilling prophecies

## The Two Components

Every Life Sentence functional constraint is composed of:

1. **The Life Sentence itself** - The judgment or decision
2. **Patterns of being and acting** - The strategies you developed to survive (win, or at least get by) within the constraints imposed by that Life Sentence

## Examples of Life Sentences

Common Life Sentences include:

- "I am not popular" or "I don't belong"
- "I am not good looking" or "I'm ugly"
- "I am not smart" or "I am not smart enough"
- "I am no good" or "I am not good enough"
- "I'll never be like him or her or them"
- "You can't trust people" or "You can't count on people"
- "They don't understand me" or "They don't know what it's like for me"
- "It's no use" or "It's hopeless"
- "Life's not fair" or "Life is hard"

**Note:** Even positive statements made by others can become Life Sentences. Children praised for "being smart" may develop a Life Sentence where their identity depends on intelligence, leaving them unwilling to have their intelligence tested and their confidence easily shaken by difficulty.

## The Fundamental Life Sentence: "There Is Something Wrong Here"

### Origin

The likelihood of a child making this decision is so huge as to be unavoidable. Children make plenty of mistakes every day. Being wrong is the most consistent happening in a young child's life.

At some point, in an incident containing threat, shock, or stress, plus confusion, doubt, or bewilderment, a child decides: **"There is something wrong here!"**

By "here," you meant where you are. This becomes the fundamental Life Sentence. Thereafter, "wrong" in any form becomes a threat.

### Evidence

This Life Sentence is evidenced by:
- Children saying "I didn't do it!" (even when that's the only possibility)
- Coming up with reasons why something happened that means they weren't to blame
- The "getting away with it" strategy (often by lying or covering up)

### Consequences

After this decision:
- Your brain scans life, others, and yourself for "wrong" in any form
- Everything occurs for you within the condition of "there is something wrong here"
- You become overly sensitive to what is or might be wrong
- You become the self-fulfilling prophecy "there is something wrong here" waiting to happen

### Compensating Strategies

We compensate with strategies such as:
- Avoiding things with risk of being wrong
- Hiding being wrong if we can
- Vigorously defending against being wrong when we cannot hide it
- Putting a lot of effort into being right
- Acquiescing to preserve our image
- Applying quick fixes to alleviate the discomfort of "wrong"

## The Life Sentence: "I Don't Belong"

### Origin

For all adolescents, belonging is a hyper-critical issue. Before adolescence, belonging was naturally satisfied by belonging to one's family. In adolescence, there is a shift to belonging in other relationships - certain friends, cliques, teams, or groups.

Given the over-sensitivity with belonging experienced in early adolescence, there will be some place you failed to belong - losing a friend, being an outsider from a group, not making the team, or simply not being as popular as others.

In a moment of stress or vulnerability with a sudden "break in belonging," you made the decision: **"I don't belong."**

### Consequences

After this decision:
- Not belonging becomes a threat
- Your brain scans life, others, and yourself for evidence of not belonging
- Everything occurs within the additional condition of "I don't belong"
- A whole lot of life becomes about being uncomfortable, separate, and somehow outside

Even when you do belong and feel comfortable, it's just another way of surviving in the world where you fundamentally don't belong. You become the self-fulfilling prophecy "I don't belong" waiting to happen.

## The "Winning Formula": A Type of Life Sentence

### Genesis

The genesis of a winning formula always starts with a decision about **what you could never be**.

There is someone in your life - a friend, parent, or someone you admire - who seems to win in life by being a certain way. A Way-Of-being that you decide you can never be.

**Example:** Kenny is a natural athlete and easy-going guy who is the most popular in school. Ralph decides he can never be like Kenny - can never win in life by being a natural athlete and being easy going.

### The Compensation

If you decide there is a Way-Of-being that wins, which you can never be, you then decide on a **compensating** Way-Of-being that will win. As this is honed, it becomes your winning formula.

### Characteristics of Winning Formulas

- They become part of your identity - your fixed Way-Of-being for winning
- They are always tied to what you decided you could never be (which exists below consciousness)
- There is little real self-expression or joy in exercising them, even when they win
- They are oriented around **winning**, not succeeding
- Once triggered, they trump any creative-thinking planning
- Resistance to them only increases their fixation
- They become what Maslow called a "golden hammer" - if the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail

## The Prison Analogy

### Invisible Bars

The difference between inmates in prison and those constrained by Life Sentences is that:
- Prison bars are ever present (up in their face)
- Life Sentence bars are invisible

While inmates want to get out of their cells, we are resigned to ours because our cells are just "the way life is" and "the way we and others are." It doesn't occur to us there are even any confines to 'get out' of.

### Surviving Within the Cell

Like inmates, we find ways to survive within our constrained opportunity set:
- What we define as "winning" is limited to what fits within our cell
- Day after day, we apply formulas and strategies to win when we can
- When winning fails, we at least get by

## The Way You Wound Up Being

The way you "wound up being" constrains you to:
- A certain range of expression
- A limited set of possible ways of being
- A fixed set of formulas or strategies for winning or getting by

There is nothing wrong with the way you "wound up being" - it has gotten you to where you are. You can polish and hone it. However, if you are committed to being a leader, you will have to break through the way you "wound up being."

## Distinguishing Life Sentences

### The Purpose

Identifying your Life Sentences is not for the purpose of explaining how you got to be the way you are. The purpose is to identify them so you can free yourself, or at least relax the grip, of the constraining and shaping they impose.

### The Process

1. **Identify** the decisions that became your Life Sentences
2. **Discover** how they have constrained and shaped your possibilities
3. **Discover** how they have constrained your expression and opportunity set of being and acting
4. **Discover** the formulas or strategies you generated to compensate

### The Result

When you have identified and dealt with your Life Sentences:
- You will be astonished by your expanded freedom to be and act
- You will see new possibilities for yourself and your life
- You will see new possibilities in others
- You will have access to what confines you to the person you "wound up being"

## Key Insights for Leaders

1. **Life Sentences are decisions, not facts** - They live as "truth" but are interpretations made in moments of vulnerability

2. **They operate invisibly** - Like air to the bird or water to the fish, they are omnipresent and therefore unnoticed

3. **They constrain all perception** - Not just listening, but your entire worldview

4. **They generate self-fulfilling prophecies** - You unconsciously create evidence for your Life Sentences

5. **Freedom requires distinguishing them** - What you don't distinguish runs you; what you do distinguish, you can work with

6. **Winning formulas prevent succeeding** - They are oriented around winning, not what would actually work

7. **Leaders must break through** - To be a leader and exercise leadership effectively, you must go beyond the way you "wound up being"
