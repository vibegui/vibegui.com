#### Director of Performance Enablement
*Sep 2020 - Jun 2021 (10 mos)*  
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

After 8 years building product, I transitioned to the Operations team where I worked to create the conditions for every team at VTEX to execute on their highest possible performance. The Performance Enablement area obsesses over the question: "what do I need to *perform* at VTEX?" We created the self-service tools to ensure our execution was aligned to our strategy and we scaled the usage of high-performance language to every level of the company. Managed: strategy planning and delivery, internal communications, internal rituals, learning & development, and performance lifecycle.

#### Staff Engineer
*Jun 2020 - Sep 2020 (4 mos)*  
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Worked in a cross-team role, helping set the direction for 20+ engineers in advancing the VTEX IO platform. My work involved architecting, articulating strategic direction to team members, writing vision documents and RFCs, developing proof-of-concepts and researching external references. In summary, I did whatever was necessary to move the action forward and make sure everyone is aligned and excited about our shared future. I also play a role representing VTEX externally whenever necessary.

#### Engineering Manager
*Nov 2019 - Jun 2020 (8 mos)*  
Greater Rio de Janeiro

From the end of 2019 to mid 2020 I worked to establish the role of Engineering Management at VTEX (there are now 20+ people in this role and growing). This was a fundamental piece in our organizational evolution towards having a clear functional hierarchy, creating an explicit structure to better support the personal and professional development of employees. I became responsible for a total of 10 senior and mid developers, performing 1:1s and making sure they were unblocked towards progress. I also played a strategic part in internally catalyzing the product vision for the VTEX IO platform, working along with the Product Marketing team to position the product to analysts like Gartner and IDC.

#### Full Stack Engineer
*May 2016 - Oct 2019 (3 yrs 6 mos)*

Worked on the development of the frontend stack of VTEX IO, our serverless development platform designed to help retailers create scalable, production-ready web applications, in which I was responsible for the first versions of our rendering and building pipelines. During this period I developed the first version of what is currently the VTEX Store Framework, a turning point in our road to modern, high-performance React-based B2C stores that enable retailers and partners to build and manage stores with greater autonomy and efficiency, compared to our previous CMS solution. As an enthusiast of organizational culture and performance, I also played a role in creating, developing, and establishing some crucial rituals (like the Demo Friday) and our core values. I also dedicated myself to actively hunting and hiring talented Software Engineers from the top Brazilian universities, developing a pitch to convince them to join VTEX instead of opting for Big Tech offers. This work eventually became the basis for a successful large-scale employer branding effort, positioning VTEX as a top-of-the-list company for new-grad SWEs in Brazil.

### 5. Teacher
**EICOM Institute**  
*Oct 2018 - Dec 2021 (3 yrs 3 mos)*

Taught a 2-hour class on Organizational Culture based on Reinventing Organizations at the Cambridge-based EICOM executive education programme.

### 6. Frontend Developer
**Tictail (acquired by Shopify)** | Full-time  
*Jul 2015 - May 2016 (11 mos)*  
Greater Stockholm Metropolitan Area

In 2014 I decided to have the experience of living and working abroad. I joined Tictail, an ecommerce platform startup for small businesses. In the Stockholm office, I worked as a frontend developer in the Checkout and Internationalization teams building the product, which was eventually acquired by Shopify. The experience was immensely enriching: I learned a lot and made great friends. However, I ultimately decided I could not work towards the improvement of my country whilst living abroad, so I decided to return to Brazil.

### 7. Lead Frontend Developer
**VTEX** | Full-time  
*Apr 2012 - Jul 2015 (3 yrs 4 mos)*  
Greater Rio de Janeiro

Joined as a full-stack developer when VTEX was architecting what would become the SmartCheckout micro-service solution. Led the frontend development team, working closely with the UX team. Contributed towards:
- The separation of frontend and back end code to enable specialized deployment pipelines
- The adoption of continuous delivery and creation of a robust internal toolset to support it
- The usage of SEMVER
- The creation of a "Summer Academy" program to hire interns in batches (similar to Google's SoC)
- The adoption of CoffeeScript for frontend projects (no regrets!)
- The adoption of Golang and NodeJS for some of the new backend projects
