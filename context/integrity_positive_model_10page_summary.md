## Page 1 — What the paper is trying to do

The authors argue that “integrity” has been conceptually muddled by being treated as a virtue concept (i.e., something about being “good,” “honest,” or “upright”). Their core move is to **redefine integrity as a *positive* phenomenon**: a descriptive property of a thing (object, system, person, organization) that is either *whole and complete* or not. On this view, integrity is not inherently “good” or “bad”—it is more like *gravity*: it has consequences whether you like it or not.

Why this matters: the authors propose that integrity is a **critical driver of performance**, not primarily through moral aspiration but through *workability*. When integrity declines, workability declines, and as workability declines, the “opportunity set” for performance shrinks. Therefore, a large portion of problems in personal and organizational life are argued to be **self‑generated by out‑of‑integrity behavior**, but these causes are frequently invisible because integrity has been confounded with morality, ethics, and legality.

The paper’s promise is practical: by separating these concepts clearly, it offers **actionable access** to improving performance (as you define performance: profit, quality of life, effectiveness, etc.) by raising integrity.

---

## Page 2 — Two realms: positive integrity vs. normative virtues

A major structural claim is that four commonly confounded ideas belong to **two different realms**:

1. **Integrity** belongs in a **positive** realm (describing “what is” in an empirically testable way).
2. **Morality, ethics, and legality** belong in a **normative** realm (describing “what ought to be,” standards of right/wrong).

Within the normative realm, the paper further distinguishes:
- **Morality** as the standards of right/wrong accepted in a society in a given era.
- **Ethics** as the standards of right/wrong agreed in a group that grants membership benefits.
- **Legality** as enforceable state standards of right/wrong backed by penalties.

The paper argues that when integrity is treated as a virtue, it becomes morally loaded and therefore subject to defensiveness, rationalization, and debate (“But I’m a good person”). By contrast, treating integrity as a positive property is meant to help people notice when integrity is compromised—because the question becomes: *Is the thing whole and complete?* rather than *Is the person good?*

This separation is also meant to *strengthen* morality/ethics/legality: once integrity is understood as a “workability” factor, people become more likely to honor moral/ethical/legal standards because of the performance consequences, not merely because they “should.”

## Page 3 — The definition: integrity as wholeness and completeness

The authors anchor “integrity” in dictionary definitions emphasizing **wholeness and completeness**. They explicitly reject dictionary definitions that fold integrity into “sound moral principle,” because that creates conceptual overlap with morality and ethics. Instead:

- Integrity is defined as a **state/condition of being whole, complete, unbroken, unimpaired, sound, in perfect condition.**
- This definition applies to objects, systems, people, groups, and organizations.
- The authors argue this makes integrity **objective** in the sense that something is either whole/complete relative to its design and context, or it is not.

An important implication: integrity is **not** a claim about someone’s character goodness. It’s a claim about *structural completeness* and *reliability of commitments*. For persons and organizations, the “object” whose integrity matters is their **word**—what they said, what is expected, what they assert as true, what they stand for, etc.

This is the conceptual bridge: integrity as a “condition” becomes practical for human entities via the notion of *word* and the discipline of honoring it.

## Page 4 — The cascade: integrity → workability → performance

A central explanatory mechanism is the “cascade”:

1. **Integrity declines** (the thing becomes less whole/complete).
2. **Workability declines** (it becomes less capable of producing intended results).
3. **The opportunity set for performance declines** (fewer outcomes remain feasible; costs rise; trust erodes; errors increase).

They illustrate with a **bicycle wheel**: remove spokes and the wheel becomes less whole; it wobbles, then fails. This shows integrity is a necessary condition for workability, and workability shapes performance.

They define workability in terms of the **opportunity set** available to an actor/system: what outcomes can be achieved given the state of integrity. Performance is deliberately broad: organizations might define it as profit or value creation; individuals might define it as happiness, quality of life, or being “whole and complete as a person.”

A strong claim is offered as an “Ontological Law of Integrity”: **to the degree integrity is diminished, the opportunity for performance is diminished.** The authors treat this as a lawful relationship they believe is empirically testable, even if they acknowledge formal evidence is still needed.

## Page 5 — Integrity in objects and systems: design, implementation, and use

For objects and systems, integrity depends on:
- **Components and their relationships**
- **Design integrity** (is the design itself whole for its intended standard?)
- **Implementation integrity** (was the design realized without missing/defective parts?)
- **Use integrity** (is it being used as designed? misuse is “out of integrity of use”)

The key is always “whole/complete relative to what makes it workable.”

This section generalizes beyond physical devices: systems can include **protocols, instructions, processes, HR strategies, and organizations**—anything with components and relationships. A “human‑including system” can be out of integrity even when the people in it have personal integrity, and vice‑versa.

A subtle point: the paper separates the integrity of a *person’s body* (physical integrity) from the integrity of a *person as a person* (word integrity). Someone can be physically impaired yet fully in integrity as a person, because integrity is defined by wholeness/completeness in the relevant domain.

## Page 6 — Integrity for persons and organizations: integrity is about “word”

For people (and for groups/organizations), the model defines integrity in a specific way:

- **Integrity for a person is solely a matter of that person’s word being whole and complete.**
- **Integrity for an organization is the organization’s word being whole and complete** (what is said inside and what is said by/on behalf of the organization).

This framing shifts integrity from “virtue” to “operational reliability” of commitments and assertions.

The paper emphasizes that you “are encountered” by others as your word: promises you made, what you asserted to be true, what you stand for, what people can count on. Similarly, you encounter yourself through your own word (including internal promises and self‑descriptions). The model claims much personal dysfunction comes from inauthenticity—acting inconsistently with one’s stated commitments or self‑understanding—creating an internal “not whole” condition.

This sets the stage for the critical technical component of the model: a precise definition of what counts as “your word.”

---

## Page 7 — What counts as “your word”: six components

The paper defines “one’s word” as six categories:

1. **What you said you would do (or not do), and by when.**  
   Includes a key rule: **requests of you become your word if you don’t respond in time** (accept/decline/counter/commit to respond later).  
2. **What you know to do (or not do), and doing it as meant to be done and on time** unless you explicitly said otherwise.  
3. **What is expected of you** (even if unexpressed), unless you explicitly decline it.  
4. **What you say is so** (assertions about reality), where you are accountable that others would find your evidence valid (or you qualify your certainty).  
5. **What you stand for** (explicitly or implicitly—what others can count on you for).  
6. **Moral, ethical, and legal standards** of the societies, groups, and governments in which you enjoy membership—unless you explicitly and publicly refuse and accept consequences.

This is one of the most “engineering‑like” moves in the paper: it attempts to enumerate the common ways a person becomes “not whole” in commitments. Notably, it includes **unspoken expectations** as a driver of breakdown—because unmet expectations reduce relationship workability whether or not they were fair.

The asymmetry is intentional: *your unexpressed expectations of others are not part of their word.* If you want something to be their word, you must request it and obtain a response.

## Page 8 — Integrity for persons: “honoring your word” (not always “keeping it”)

With “word” defined, integrity for a person is defined as:

> **Integrity = honoring your word.**

Honoring your word has two modes:

1. **Keep your word** (do what you said you would do, on time).  
2. If you won’t keep your word, then **as soon as you know**, you:
   - inform all impacted parties that you won’t keep it,
   - state what you *will* do instead (by when) or that you won’t do it at all,
   - and **clean up the consequences** (deal with the impact on others).

This is crucial: the authors explicitly say that **always keeping your word is impossible if you are playing a meaningful game**, because life is uncertain and commitments exceed perfect control. But it is always possible to *honor* your word by repairing integrity quickly and transparently.

They also stress that integrity is an “and” proposition: honoring includes *both* attempting to keep word *and* taking responsibility when you cannot. This is what makes it actionable: you cannot “do” wholeness, but you can “do” honoring.

---

## Page 9 — Why cost‑benefit analysis corrodes integrity (and trust)

A provocative argument in the paper is that **applying cost‑benefit analysis to honoring your word guarantees untrustworthiness**—because the other party learns your commitments are contingent on opportunistic recalculation.

The one exception they mention is “arcane” and socially costly: if you explicitly disclose at the time of giving your word that you will apply cost‑benefit analysis later, then you might technically retain integrity because the “word” you gave included that contingency—but you have also declared yourself an opportunist, and you should expect diminished trust and reduced relational workability.

The model treats this as a widespread hidden failure mode: people habitually justify broken commitments (“I had good reasons”) without realizing that the justification does not prevent the collapse of workability. The key is not moral blame; it is the structural consequence: broken word shrinks the opportunity set because coordination costs rise, conflict increases, and the environment becomes less predictable.

This is one place where the paper’s language overlaps with organizational execution: commitments that “really mean it” are a platform for scale; commitments that are casually reversible produce friction and defensive bureaucracy.

## Page 10 — Implications, applications, and how to use the model

### Practical implications the paper emphasizes
- **Integrity is a production factor:** as fundamental as knowledge or technology, because it shapes how much performance is even available.
- **Many problems are self‑inflicted:** out‑of‑integrity behavior generates hidden costs (rework, delay, distrust, politics, reduced coordination bandwidth).
- **Integrity is not “virtue signaling”:** it’s an operational discipline: *be whole with your word.*
- **Morality/ethics/legality become more workable:** treating them as part of one’s word clarifies accountability and increases adherence.

### Typical application patterns
- **Personal execution:** treat promises to self as real “word”; clean up misses quickly to restore internal wholeness and reduce self‑deception.
- **Leadership and management:** clarify requests, obtain explicit responses, surface unspoken expectations, and make “word honoring” the norm.
- **Organizational design:** design systems where commitments are explicit, trackable, and repairable; reduce incentives to hide or rationalize broken word.

### A “simple” operating loop (in the paper’s spirit)
1. Identify what “word” exists (promises, known obligations, expectations, assertions, standards).
2. Keep it when possible.
3. When you won’t keep it, declare it fast.
4. Renegotiate and clean up impact.
5. Repeat—integrity is an ongoing practice, not a badge.

### Limits and cautions (worth keeping in mind)
- The model’s power rests on treating integrity as objective; in real life, disputes arise about what was “expected,” what was “known,” or what counts as “cleaning up.”
- The paper frames the integrity→performance relationship as “law‑like” and testable; operationalizing measurement is hard and context‑dependent.
- The model can be used instrumentally; without moral/ethical/legal commitments, high integrity could increase one’s ability to pursue bad ends. The paper acknowledges this tension and ties integrity back to virtue standards via “word‑6.”

## Key Terms (quick reference)

- **Integrity (positive):** wholeness and completeness (of an object/system or of a person’s/organization’s word).  
- **Workability:** capability to produce intended results; determines the **opportunity set** for performance.  
- **Performance:** any defined outcome (profit, value creation, quality of life, effectiveness).  
- **One’s word:** six-part structure (said, known, expected, asserted, stood-for, virtue standards).  
- **Honoring your word:** keep it; or disclose non‑keeping quickly and clean up consequences.
